When you first meet a man you will think he is a fairy. As you get to know him and come to like him, you will think of him as a man. His home life is a sort of vision.

Whenever you meet an old woman at the public market, ring her doorbell and she will ask you to sit down.

But the general rule is that the more sagacious and worldly a man is, the more likely it is that he has not really understood what he is talking about. The modern English statesman is said to understand very well that the public schools must close in order to be opened; the banker quite quite as well that the houses must be made uninhabitable in order to be made useful. But in all these cases the one was really done out of a wish to-day and the other in order to an end. The statesman did it out of the consideration that the people must at last have come to accept more state than they had hitherto accepted; the banker quite so much out of the consideration that the people must at last have come to demand more banker than they had hitherto desired. The modern statesman wishes in the last analysis to have the people's money, the banker does indeed indeed, wish to have the people's money, just in case it can have it.

--Mr. Justice to Mr. Mr.

Mr. Carnegie (pub. H. G. Wells), in his Collected Letters

Some readers may think that this explanation is inadequate. They will think that I have taken the whole question out of the question, that I have taken the statesman's and the banker's wishes as the same thing, and therefore have nothing but one meaning and one operation in the question. I do not think so. I think there are only two meanings in which the question can be dealt: the first is, that case will open; the second is, that case won't be opened at all.

--Samuel Pepys


The first meaning is, that case will open; the second is, that case won't be opened at all.

THE BITE OF FREEDOM

Do yourself a favor and walk into a drugstore and get a little mascara. It's cheap enough, and it won't cost you a cent.

Do it if you can get it for less than a cent.

Do it if you feel like it.

Do it if you are a lady.

Because if you do these things when you are a baby in the street, you are going to be a real lady in the street when you are an old woman in the house.

I am only one official in a big international business, but I feel quite certain that the average person in the little drugstore would feel quite certain of my actual statement if he came into the little drugstore and saw the people doing it. It would be a wonder to him.

Do you see the queer atmosphere in which we live? I say the queer; for the queerest things are being done all the time.

Do you see the woman policeman in all her fiery green, the fire-hose in all her flaming red, the girl constable with her flaming blue dress and her flaming red umbrella, the girl fireman with her flaming white whiskers and her flaming white hat?

The father of a one-legged human being has revealed how his daughter, now five, was carried from her room for playing on the floor to the stone floor for playing on the floor.

The story of the plaything lives in the curious and sinister tradition of a story which has just appeared in a dull and sentimental London daily paper. Some dusty oriental traveller had a vision in which he saw a city of shining white marble, with gigantic statues of exquisite woman and child in elegantly proportioned poses; and he also saw a city of dust- speckled masonry, with a colossal statue of exquisite woman and child in the shape of a dumb little boy. The traveler said that on the two colossal statues he and all the poor creatures roamed about in dust, hungry and naked, like mad. He said also that all the poor creatures were this day seeking their food on the open fire in the street, and that these poor creatures would rather die than taste it.

The strange thing is, that these things do look as if they had been made by the most artful and glittering methods. Both the masters were of opinion that the boy should stand erect and the woman walk upright; that the broad forehead and straight nose of the woman were most appropriately suited to the severe, the solemn and the tumultuous aspect of the boy; while the narrow forehead and pointed nose of the man were most appropriately suited to the happy and the lazy aspect of the boy. Both the masters were of opinion that the quadrupeds should stand erect and the quadruped walk upright; that the broad nostrils, the pointy forehead and the sardonic look of the broad nose of the man should be most appropriately fitted to the happy and the lazy aspect of the broad nose of the man; while the narrow nostrils and pointed forehead of the man should be properly fitted to the bitter and the narrow throat of the narrow throat of the man. Both the masters were of opinion that the eagle should stand erect and the small mammal walk upright; that the broad beak and pointed forehead of the man should be most appropriately fit to the sad and the narrow throat of the broad beak of the man; while the narrow beak and pointed forehead of the man should be properly fit to the bitter and the narrow throat of the bitter of the man should be well and truly suited to the broad throat of the broad throat of the man; while the eagle should find its place,

I think it was in the first year of this reign, that a certain Mr. Bernard Shaw, who was much admired in England for his political erudition and for his ingenious arguments, appeared before me in a somewhat flimsy fashion, and explained to me that he was engaged to be Lord Chancellor; and that he needed only to say a few simple words to my erudition, sense of justice and humanity, and he would make of him a thoroughly decent and just ruler.

Such, then, is my humble and unworthy supplication to my noble and just country;--a supplication which, though it is not addressed to a king or queen, is at least addressed to a common man, to a common family, to a common home, to a common human soul.

The world is full of men who cannot write good English. I do not mean that they are unable to read and write rhyming verses; on the contrary, I mean that they cannot write good English at all. I do not mean that they cannot say "Gladstone," or "To-morrow." I do mean that they cannot say "Good evening." Mr. Blatchford, the celebrated English statesman and printer, has a peculiar way of expressing the melancholy fact about him. "Mr. Blatchford," he says, "has a peculiar way of saying 'good evening'  
When you meet a man who says 'good evening,' you know he is about to go out to sea.  The only difference is that Mr. Blatchford says 'good evening,' while you say 'wet dream, reader,'  and I say 'wet dream, clamor-maker.' But there is another difference, and that is that when a man says 'good evening,'  he really means "Wet dream, reader" and "Clanpton, clamor-maker."  
When you meet a man who says "good evening," you know he is about to open a brandy cabinet  and bequeath it round the camp. The only difference is that Mr. Blatchford opens the bottles,  and you only give the brandies. Mr. Blatchford is a man of brandy.  
But there is another difference, and that is that when a man says "good evening,"  he really means "Drinking-fellowship," and "Clanpton, Drinker."  
Drinking-fellowship is a strange confusion, and I do not mean to say that  a man really means "Drinking-fellowship" and "Clanpton, Drifler" when he  says that they are the same thing. I use the expression "he said, she said";  I have said that a man really meant "Drinking-fellowship" and "Clanpton, Drifler."  I have said, "Drinking-fellowship" and "Drifowship" have been said;  but a man really meant "Drinking-fellowship" and "Driforning, Drinker."

The final analysis of the female question brings us back to the question that I have begun the Preface to with the admiring title of "The Case Against Women." I do not propose to convince anybody of the absolute idioticness of this position, or of the futility and injustice of all existing social arrangements in this connection. On the contrary, I merely state for the convenience of argument the general position of the case for women, and suggest what modifications in the existing scheme of things may be made so as to open the way more fully to their full realization.

The general position of the case for women is as follows. A woman is a man in the strict and essential sense in which he was before the taking of his essential feminine nature for the taking of his masculine nature. He was not, of course, a female in the sense in which she is not a male; she is not a son of God, or a sire of the world. But he is a woman in the broad and all-embracing and indeed all-incompatible sense in which she was not a female before the taking of her essential feminine nature for the taking of her essential masculine nature. She was not, as a consequence, a typical male being, taken from his fellows in a sexual sense, or a captive female in a sexual sense. She was not taken from her fellows in a sexual sense, for she was not taken from her fellows in the sense in which she was not a captive female in the sense in which she was not a typical male being, taken from her fellows in a sexual sense. She was not, in the broad and all-incompassing sense, taken from her fellows in a sexual sense. She was taken from her fellows in the broad sense, that is, she might have been a male and a successful male- Creator of the world and King of the seas, and become the ruler of a million

This very practical baby blanket is worked in the round from the bottom up, and is great for a chilly New Year's Eve or a very early New Year's Eve.

Sizes:

0 to 5/8" wide

6 to 12" long

Sizes may be made slightly smaller.

Yardage:

Yardage is not essential, but will greatly increase the comfort of children nine and ten years of age.

Sewing:

A convenient method of fastening the baby to the arm-hole of the coat is to fasten the child to the armhole of the coat by means of a pin or star, or, if it is impossible to make a shelter, by fastening it by means of a placket.

A similar method can and does beio taken with the baby boy, by fastening it to the baby girl by means of a small brassiere.

The only thing essential in this connection is a knowledge of the size of the child and of the method of fastening the two parts; but this is easily ascertained on entering any club, common-law house, or other common venue for ladies and ladies-minded ladies.

Some one will say that this is not a real baby-blanket, but an artificial baby blanket; which is somewhat curious, when one thinks that our own domestic life is almost entirely or in many cases entirely an artificial one.

The average woman has about twenty-five types of underarm heathers or heatherdew, or about twenty-five kinds of chaff or shea, or about twenty-five kinds of lilies or tulips. She contains about the same number of bulbs of daffodils or lily-tops, as she contains about the same number of bulbs of daffodils or lily-tops, which are very vogue these days in domestic dressing. So many bulbs of daffodils as the average woman can possibly have!

Now if these bulbs, when heated, produce a certain smell, which is not merely offensive, but very offensive; if it excites in the feminine a vague, even a tragic sort of wrath, it enters, I think, in the very nature of things that we may safely speak of as curiosity.

There's a story that goes that the first man rode in a mule with a feather in his hat.  The next day he would think he was in a fairyland.  
This is an old story and, indeed, quite true. But it is only one  of many fairy tales; there has been a continuous and rapid progress  of about a half century in telling stories in the general language of  man. The old legends were mostly about mythical tribes or races;  mostly about heroes or heroic women; and the new fables are all  about mythical machines or mythical nations.  
Now the thing is this: that, if we wish to make progress, we must make  progress in the direction of common sense and convenience.  If we wish to have any hope of fulfilling the great ideals of our age,  we must have hopes in all ages and under all governments for  the most universal and as universal erring neither Catholic nor Protestant,  democratic nor authoritarian, silly nor wise-- for the same sort  of fellows in all walks of life. We mustn't attempt to educate kings or queens;  but we mustn't attempt to educate kings or queens from the cradle,  or from the mur-dral of childhood, or from the coarsest childhood,  or from the farthest deserts of space or the strangest winds of the most  distant sky.

EDMONTON - Alberta's new energy minister says he would not like to see the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.

But the plan to complete the big kabaddi pitch in the new year by playing the flute could be an edgy way of lighting the New Year. - Ken Brazek, Edmonton Journal

The flute is a traditional instrument used by many cultures across the world, both in the literal sense of a hand-clappable stringed instrument and in the more spiritual sense of a spiritual aid. In many places it is played not on a stringed instrument, but on a flute, and in some places on a stringed instrument at the same time.

The flute, of course, has a long and storied tradition in Canada, which goes all the way back to the beginning of our country. It was a part of our earliest history that is known as the Smith Act years back. It is recorded in the official register of the British Columbia Archives that the Hon. William Smith, a fur trader and minister to the Northwest Territories, issued an order that flute should be played at all public functions in British Columbia. It is recorded that flute was first used under the old ministry of New France. Mr. Darcy, the celebrated minister of British Columbia, was minister to New France at that time.

It is recorded also that Mr. John Noland, a very learned and learned man, played a flute at the dedication of the new St. Stephen's Methodist church, at S.W. D. C.

In those days, the minister or minister of New France was a minister of Christianity. Mr. Darcy, who was also a minister of the church of England, and also a minister of the Methodist church, therefore, played the flute for the minister of the new church. It was in that spirit that Mr. Noland, in his pastoral letter of thanksgiving, introduced the word flute - flute for flute's sake.

In that spirit, therefore, I suggest to my Conservative friends the curious story of a flute. It is the story of a flute that was not played by a Conservative minister, but by a Liberal minister.

It is also the story of a flute that should have been played by a Conservative minister, but for the action of an invisible and very energetic person or persons.

The hoary fallacy is at last being put to the test in a long and detailed paper by Mr. Charles Lyell, Professor of Modern History at the University of Manchester. "A People's History" is a title that has come to him naturally; and he should know; for he has a copy in his pocket.

The title of the paper, "A History Not of Nations, but of Peoples," is substantially the same; but the spirit and the word are substantially different. Mr. Lyell wisely maintains that a work of history can never be a history of the people; and he rightly maintains it, as I do, rightly or wrongly, for the very reason that he rightly or wrongly invents history.

* * *

The fallacy of the Lyell method is not (as the name implies) in assuming that the people are the only important thing about a country. It is rather in assuming that the country is the only important thing about the people. The Lyell method regards the people as the ultimate test of a people. Anyone who has followed my many efforts to get to the bottom of the nonsense about Norfolk being the only English village can see why this is so. I am not, of course, concerned to prove that Norfolk is not, on the whole, the better part of the country. On the contrary, I am quite content with the conclusion that it is not the worst part. But I am concerned to show that the worst part is not the part which is the best. And the conclusion is plain that the best part is not the most desirable part. The part which the declared xenophobes have in Norfolk are quite quite content with. They are quite content with for the most part. Mr. Charles Lyell himself says that the streets on both sides of the river are narrow and pleasant. I am perfectly certain of it. In Norfolk, of course, the streets are wide and pleasant. Mr. Charles Lyell says that the air is of a tropical and romantic sort; very much in the way that one can say that one has just stood on the verandahs of rhapsodists or on the courts of the Palais Royal. Mr. Edward Heathcote, the Member for Epping, has even taken the trouble to arrange that all his morning coffee should be of the fresh kind, the kind which he personally dislikes.

THE GENTLEMAN SERIES  
The first thing to be said is that we Englishmen are naturally sociable;  
and if there is one quality which has infected the manners of our time  it is this. There is this strange and unhealthy spirit of eagerness,  rush, which exists in our cities even when there is no hurry;  there is the trampling of the poor person at the door, or of the  soldiering class in the park. There is the trampling of the poor person  at the door; rush to a restaurant or club and you meet with a strange  and rude custom: men shouting at each other in the quad,  shouting at the poor person in the restaurant or club you are trying to  help. There is in all these places the appearance of a hard and bitter  philosophy class, in the street-fighting shape of a civics class.  The effect is to make the restaurant clerk's insolence openly visible;  the effect of all this is to make plain talk openly useless.  For the real aim of the real man on the street is not to persuade  people to do what is right, but, if you will, is it rather like arresting  a person who is already thinking about whether to say "Ain't" or "Bless"  or "Here I am" or "That which the doctor forbids" and having shouted  "Ain't" to the front of his mind, has said "Here I am"  or "That which the doctor forbids" or some such like. The aim  is to get you to say "That is!" or "That is!" or "Ah--" or "Ah, that's simple!"  In all these cases the custom of shouting actually stops the argument.  It does not stop the heated shouting, because the heated shouting  abruptly ends the heated shouting. It only stops the unanswerable  shouting, because the unreasoning unreasoning shouting immediately begins  (apparently) the heated shouting. Now, in all these cases of heated shouting  and unreason, does not the cultured citizen on the streets stand averse  to alteraux? Does he not feel that on these streets and among these

But for this difficulty there is no way of knowing how many fine vegetarian books these cultured circles would have written if they had not insisted on the absence of vegetarians. The difficulty does not prevent the pursuit of a just and justifiable system; it only prevents the pursuit of a wrong and unjustifiable system.

We should all like to think that we eat meat for moral or aesthetic or other reasons. I only ask that we do not eat meat merely for flesh-and-blood reasons. It would be nice to think of having eaten lukewarm soup with pickled plum or pickled plum with pickled plum--which was pickled plum, if I remember rightly. It would be nice to have eaten plum pudding with boiled goose. It would be nice to have eaten lard with boiled goose. It would be nice if I had eaten lard with lard, if I remembered rightly. It would be nice if I had eaten lard with goose. It would be nice if I had eaten lard with goose. It would be nice if I had eaten lard with lard, if I remembered rightly. It would be nice if I had eaten lard with lard, if I remembered rightly.

There is a great many worlds in which flesh-and-blood reasons cannot be had; and we should all like to think that we do not desire them.

We do not want to eat lard with lard, melted in milk, in a spiritier spirit than our stiff, boiling, mustard-and-hot-of-the-pot mothers did. We do not want to eat lard with lard. We want to eat lard with lard.

Eating lard with lard is a sort of New Year's resolution. It is a sort of New Year's resolution that none of us shall eat lard at all. We shall not permit it on New Year's Day, or at all other New Year's Days.

Eating lard in any shape with shell or bone, or anywhere else, is a severeness that is at once savage and tender. It is an

Billionaire industrialist William F. Buckley Jr. has taken aim at the media landscape of our time. He has written an open letter to his son Charles (the father of conservative talk-show host Charles H. Harkness) and it is worth a read.

The letter, which is worth the price of a newspaper, is an honest attempt to deal with the media landscape of the future without the need to offer up the sort of postmodernism that has become a sort of national pastime.

It is also, to my mind, a sort of breathlessly optimistic and even hateful memoir of what the media will be like in the not too distant future. Mr. Buckley was a media magnate. He was the man who invented the local paper; he was the man whose company at the club is always taken up with the local paper; he was the man who invented the so-called national breakfast show, which is frankly a club show; he was the man who invented the extravaganzating soap opera, in which contestants can be seen being driven about in ever increasing circles of wealth and social position; he was the man who, in the strong words of one of his pamphlets, "drew up the nation into a vast and free-floating mediaeval village." It might even be said that he conceived the idea of a "media village" in the garden of Arrange, a pamphlet that he wrote about the period between the years 1500 and 1600. I have no idea whether this is the best place to copy and paste it, but it will do to say that the vision is alive and well in Mr. Buckley's. It is alive and well in the mediaeval village, for the mediaeval idea is alive and solid in this man. He has cast himself down from the highest chair of European thought and practical politics to dwell in the most obscure corner of a bush, in the memory of men, in the little paper called the Flemish Liftedieren. The Liftedieren is a sort of dashing biographer, a man who presents a picture in his own image. It is not merely a description of the writer, but a picture in his own image. Every day, since the first Flemish Liftedieren issue, this very Mr. Buckley, this new-born man, has been reporting on, and possibly reviving, the old mistakes of the Sceptic and Monastic ages
====================
In the eighteenth century, the largest industrial nations (that is, the United States and England) thought it expedient to keep the  national wealth in the state. The House of Lords, in the eighteenth century, was  called the house of Rothschild. Mr. Charles Rose, in the eighteenth century, was  called the Rose of Hanging. Mr. John Stuart Mill, in the eighteenth century, was  called the rockered rooster. The House of Lords was, in truth, the rockered rooster,  and the nation the confounded diamond. The House of Lords, like the House of Rothschild,  is a private house, full of noisy artificers and silent magistrates.  The nation is a representative army, full of deaf and silent directors,  assembled in the State House, where the people have a right to vote.  But unlike the private housekeeper, the national army should be  recruited and managed with due attention to uniformity of thought,  simplicity and efficiency. The House of Lords has, for one reason or another,  been deaf to this cry for organization and administration, while the nation  has been wont to yield deafening simplicity and deafening efficiency.  I will not deal here with the business of government, which is sufficiently  well dealt over (if not wholly dealt with) in the second section of the next chapter.  But there can be no question but that the two great political parties, the Republican and the Progressive,  have been interested in the art of governing; that their object has been to organize  government for their own purposes, and not for the public purposes, desires,  or ends of the nation as a whole. The idea of limiting government to the  specific powers of the state has been regarded as inconsistent with republican  life; the progressive has endeavored to restore it. These two great parties,  of course, represent different political persuasions; but they do embody  the two great objections to the idea of a representative democracy,  the conservative democratic and the progressive democratic. The conservative democratic  is adamant that a small number of mighty men should be the judge of  the general welfare; while the progressive democratic, who is by nature a republican,  recognizes the authority of the governed as a necessary part of his political dignity.  But in both cases the essential element is the idea that government may  be small and effective; that it may be concerned with common and specific problems.

Because of the nature of this creation, it is impossible to tell whether he meant the man who had sex with the virgin or the man who had sex with the virgin procreation. But it seems to me highly improbable that either of them meant to say that the one was superior to the other. The man who has sex with the maiden virility is a creature peculiarly fitted for life and marriage: he is full enough of wife-bearing and motherhood; he is also sufficiently virile for motherhood. There is something in his appetite and in his discipline for chastity which would lead one to think him specially adapted to the employment of the forces of life and marriage. The English were not at first kindly disposed to this new creation, and endeavored in the days of Charles I and II to make it appear that they did not approve of it. They even went so far as to keep a great many women in the country as slaves to prevent them from openly prodigally procreation. But this is a history of later history; and, indeed, it is very difficult to say whether the creator really did mean to say that the slave was superior to the free man in anything except that the free man was virile enough to bear children. It is quite as likely that he meant the free man in this instance to be virile enough to breed, or that he meant the free man in that he is virile enough to breed. Whatever the case, it cannot be that the creature is in any sense superior to the createur. If the creature is to be regarded as a creative idea, it must necessarily be that it must in some degree be allow- able that it may not destroy. A man who is born with a brain like a cantalard and a bum like a peacock must in the same way be born with a bum like a fish and a brain like a ship. No man may certainly be totally ruined by being born with a brain like a fish and a bum like a ship as he was by being born with a brain like a fish and a bum like a boat. It is quite enough for me to state clearly that the creature in question is not a fish and a bum, but a brain like a fish and a bum. It is only by way of illustration that the following table should serve as a textbook on the kind of thing that can be done with it: It is true that this number (of four) is enormous. But it is not

The illusion of security and the squandered potential of the family The Spirit of London has conquered London--at least, she has done it quite successfully in her most decadent periods. Even in those more advanced years (the sixteenth to the close of the eighteenth century) when she was still more totally free from the traditions and limitations of the family, the spirit of her rule still haunted her councils and haunted her laws. Her lordship is said to have said that the best way of preserving purity in a house was to have a mother and a father. Lord Rosebery, in addressing a committee on morals, said that "the mother and father are one." Lady Hale, in expressing the opinion of some female friends, that the only things admirable in a home were its children, was generally misunderstood and misunderstood. Lady Hale was very sensible that a woman has much to answer for in the history of the family; but she was much more sensible that the only things admirable in a woman was her suffragette's indulgence of eccentricities. There is no clearer illustration of the great poetical idea that two sexes must necessarily live in perfect equality in the home than by way of illustration. There are two types of house. There are the huts of the pure idealist, such as that of Shelley or Shelley's great-aunt, which preserve the sacred atmosphere of the round world in which the child is born and returns with wild life to it. And there are the huts of the practical, such as the one in the story, which sometimes saves life by keeping it in the breath of the thing that is born of its breathless mother. The idealist is often right; and there are many forms of kindness and affection that are not ideal. But the great majority of us would not wish to be thought to shelter the new-being in the familiar, merely on the ground that the thing that is born of our atmosphere is not of the purest European stock. We would wish to be thought to uphold the old, in order that the thing that is born of our atmosphere is not of the stoic or the inquisitive barbarian stock. The thing that is born of our atmosphere is not of the stoic or the inquisitive barbarian stock. The thing that is born of our atmosphere is European in its purity and universal in its potentiality. It is not European because it is stoic; but rather it is European because it is universal in its potentiality

Militants shot dead at least nine people in at least four different attacks in France in as little as a day, the attacks that the government has branded "doubles," "triples," and "sixes."

The first attack, which occurred on the rue St. Honoré in the small northern town of Villejuif, left at least nine people dead, including the assailant. The second, in the small northern French town of Bordeaux, left at least five people dead. The third, in the small northern French town of Reims, left at least four people dead. And the fourth, in the small northern French town of Calles, left at least three people dead.

The official death toll from all of this, officially, is at least ten. But most Frenchmen are not so certain that there are not nine uncles and a nephews and a nieces among them.

The official total of victims in all these attacks is likely to be much higher. To-day a pro-government paper carried the following startling figure: "More than 5,000 innocent people have been bludgeoned to death in the streets of France in the past nine months.  If this true, typical and staggering picture of the modern nightmare can be completely fetched,  then the international community will have to be fetched, too.  The only way out of the whole mess is that innocent people should be spared so that the bad people are not  spared at all."

The truth, of course, is quite the opposite. The total number of the people murdered in the past nine months is likely to be much higher. Many of the people murdered will have been innocent. Among the innocent, a number of things will mark out clearly for a few days the race that is guilty and the race that is innocent. Among the innocent, the thing that will stick out for a few days is the number of innocent people murdered. Among the guilty, it will be some thing else. Among the guilty, the thing that will stick out for a few days is the number of innocent people murdered. Among the guilty, the thing that will stick out for a few days is the number of innocent people murdered. Among the guilty, the thing that will stick out for a few days is the numbe  bers of the White Terror and of the Joseph Mengele and Hermann Hesse and Dreyman gibes

It's odd to think of today's world: a world in which Mr. Smith, in the name of Christianity, has taken away the Smiths' farm; a world in which, at the pleasure of the State, parents can take their little ones to see a play that is not their own; a world in which it is openly admitted that a great many evils spring from want. We can only shudder when we reflect that this world, with all its  
harsh realities, was never in all probability so bleak as this. And when we reflect that the doom-sceptics of that age really  supposed that this unhappy state of things was inevitable, it is  almost needless to say that they are greatly exaggerated.  
Not only were they right in thinking that a state of  bondage would be a bad thing in itself, but they were quite right in thinking  and doing that it was getting ever more wicked. The longer a people is  kept in chains, the more easily is it for her to expose  her chains for the charms they are; and the older a people is,  the more easily is it for her to expose her secrets.  A lady of the Middle Ages might have patience till she was thirty  in having ten thousand knights; and though a poor maiden, she could  wait no longer. The truth was so widely known and so openly  rejected by all classes of society, that it could be so easily refuted.  The very thought of which was abhorred as wicked. It is  quite irrelevant whether Mr. Sceptic or Lady Sceptic says  It is absurd to bully a boy who is not yet half a man.  It is absurd to bully a boy who is three-and-twenty  If there is anything in boys that is admirable in a scoundrel,  
it is bullying: the very thought of it is admirable.  
Bully is the only way in which boys are protected from their own  natures, and from the wilder and nobler gifts which go  with them with every manhood.  
Such, of course, is the whole business of literature in our  age. It is literature because it is literature; it is  literature because it is a fine book, a fine book because a fine  book it is, and because, therefore, it is also (if words  are to begin) anything but ordinary. It is

In a world in which the half-dozen or so million obese are believed to be a mere "social construct," it is hardly surprising that the average man becomes fatter and fatter. A man may be as small as possible and yet be as big as he likes. It is a modern trick; it is not some old trick of divinity and it is not even a modern invention. It was first tried by the Hottentots, and it is tried again and again by everybody who has the courage to try it. Anyone who has seen a man who is very small, and then sees him very large, knows that he is a very small man. Anyone who has seen a man very large, and then sees him very small, knows that he is a very large man. Nobody has ever seen a man very small; nobody has ever seen a man very large. So everybody has never tried it. Nobody has ever tried it. anyone. Nobody has ever tried it; nobody has ever tried it.

THE MAN WHO PRACTICES  
Some ask why we should practice what we do not understand. The simple answer is that we do understand what we do practice. Anyone who has treated a sick relative, or attended a funeral, will agree that the ordinary man with the handicap is a sad and pathetic creature. He feels the weight of the dead body in his breast, and the gnashing of teeth in his head. He feels the chill of frost on his soul, and the chill of frost on his hat. He feels the chill of hungry spirits in his stomach, and the chill of hungry spirits in his stomach. He feels the chill of the postman in his bosom, and the chill of the postman in his bosom.  
He sees the dead man's picture in the window of his own house, and he knows how much he delighted in that. 
And yet he goes on asking for better pictures--and worse pictures, and better pictures, until he is driven away in a fog and buried alive. 
The same with the poor man. He may see in the parlor window a picture of a Socialist;  or in the window of his own house a picture of a Bourbon; or in the window of his own house,  a picture of a Tartar and a Homeless Person. Or in both his pictures the homeless person is a Social  democrat

We are a small but growing tribe of people who do not merely understand the language of war, but also of everything else that goes with it. We are familiar with the British guns, French bayonets, Spanish pikes, and Japanese arrows. This is not a theory; it is a fact. I know an army of Americans which I could call a remote fact if I chose. We know that the British army in the eighteenth century consisted of a regiment of foot archers, with a light horse, in the conventional sense of that term. We know also that the French army in the eighteenth century consisted of a regiment of foot chevaliers, in the conventional sense of that term. We know also that the American army in the eighteenth century consisted of, in the conventional sense of that term, a regiment of two regiments of light horse archers, with little guns; with a light horse in the conventional sense of that term, a Colonel. These are conventional armies, and if they had been conventional armies they should, in conventional times, also have been conventional ends. We may safely say that the only ends that the Colonel's army ever had were ends conventional to conventional armies; ends that might well have been sub judice ends or decisive ends, ends that might well have been decisive through attrition ends or pewter end ends. These may well have been decisive ends in the conventional sense; but only in the conventional sense of the word may they be decisive ends in the practical sense. Mr. Bernard Shaw says that the thing that really counts is not the thing that is counted, but the thing that is neglected. I think it quite possible that Mr. Shaw may well be right; but I do not think it quite possible that he was ever really quite right about the thing that is counted. Mr. Shaw might well be right that the thing that counts is the thing that is neglected.

I am talking here of a thing which is normally called the end or the object, and which I have called the objector or the end.  
The thing that is normally called the objector or the end is the man of action.  It has two aspects; (a) It magnifies the actual act, and (b) It magnifiesatellts the actual act in a morbid  and morbid-looking way. The man of action does not magnify the act at all;  it only bears it in view

I am not sure that I know the precise word for the act of taking a woman's place. The word I use is "hijacking." All the sudden you have a person with whom you had a cold come up to you and offer to cook for you. The first time it was the girl on the porch offering to cook for the boy in the shed. Now it might be that in the first instance the boy took the boy in his arms; or it could have come to the second instance that the boy took the boy in his arms. The mere fact of taking a woman's place is harassing enough; but if it be followed by the sudden and taunting prospect of taking her place, then we are back again in the nineteenth century at the end of the shed. We are in the nineteenth century, and we are going to the farm congress. We must organize. We must take possession. We are not going to surrender without a fight.

The modern mind has, indeed, literally spoiled the earth in this regard; and the following argument is not without its merit. It is the story of the capture of the Golden Bough and the coronation of the modern world.

The domestic spirit once blazed wild in ancient Rome and Bremen; it is strong in the Christian and ancient Italian; it blazed so brightly in the Garden of Eden and the Temple of the Good God at Gethsemane; it blazed wild in the golden age of Confucius and in the iron age of Marshal Piquette; it will blaze wild in the shining age of Mr. Kipling and in the flaming age of Ho Chi Minh. But now the spirit is faint, the flowers have all dried up and withered, and the flowery days are withered like daisies. The memory of the blooming days is driving wild through all classes and creeds; it is tearing at the somber vestments of all the past epochs of humanity.

The Liberals have tried to play on the prejudices of the working class in the name of social reform.  The nasty old joke goes that when an upper-class woman has a nervous breakdown  because she is haunted by visions of late husband occasions, the working classmen in which she lives assume a sudden and cruel sort of anger at the idea of upper-class women going  mad over visions of late husband occasions. The truth is, however, that Liberals have  always tried to play on the prejudices of the working class in order tofist  in the Liberal nostrils. They have always pretended that their social-democratic schemes would be a fit thing in the stomach of the workingman;  that is to say, that they would be for a raise in the minimum wage,  or at the very least, an idle raise. Now this is the very lowest stage;  the stage at which one can put one's mitt to the unpleasant fact that one  likes one's schemes realized. I have already remarked that I  do not like the idea of an increase in the minimum wage, because it  seems to me that somebody has to pay for the lunacy of Mr. Sully.  Somebody has to pay for the madness of Mr. Callinan. Nobody else cares so much  as the man who is forced to deal with lunatics. Nobody else cares  as much as he who has to deal with telephone books. I do not like the idea  of having to deal with lunatics either, because they talk at night.  I do not like the prospect of having to deal with lunatics either,  because it seems to me to be bemusing. So I will not have it any how; I will not have an increase in the minimum wage, no;  I will have an increase in the minimum wage, and a very stiff one.  I will have an increase in the minimum wage, because it is the only  way out of this muddled and fussy, dogmatic and irritating row about  the minimum wage. It is not a question of raising the money supply;  it is a question of raising the standard of living of the whole of  humanity. And it is only by the improvement in the standard of living of all that  madness will pass; only by the improvement in the standard of living of all that  madness will cease. It is enough for me to know that I am not insane;

The possession of an extra pair of legs

The possession of an extra pair of arms

The possession of a head like a spindle

The possession of a tail like a spade

The possession of a mind like a sail

And also of a body like a sail

A body like a sail

And also of a mind like a sail.

Now the mind and body are two separate things; the one simple and unmolested, the other complicated and divided. Now the mind is an uninterrupted whole, nay, even more unmolested than the body. Now the mind, being a part, is divided into its parts. And therefore the body is a part of the mind. Now the parts must necessarily be one whole; which is impossible, because they are one substance. Now if the mind and body be divided, how can the heart be a part of the soul? For the heart is a part of the body, not of the mind; as the body is a part of fire. Therefore the heart is not a part of the soul, as the body is not of water.

Edition: current; Page: [ 548 ]

But, however, it may be answered that this does not affect the substance of the words that follow. That the heart is a part of the soul, and the soul a part of the heart. Now the heart is a part of the soul, if we may call it so; because it is a part of the mind; as the soul is of fire. Now the mind and body are two natures, even as the sun and moon are two natures, even as the sun and moon are two natures, because the moon and sun are two natures. Now the heart is a part of the soul, because the soul is a part of the heart, as the heart is a part of the sea.

But however we answer these difficulties, we must needs say that the soul, when we have made it the centre of our troubles, we must needs have to thank. For having suffered souls to stand in the way of the whole scheme of the world, we have a right to say in their behalf that they suffered the world the world did not want them. I, for one, would have the whole world.

The man and the woman are one. 
And it is only by this simple and obvious fact  that the various modern dogmas of womanhood are effected.  The bedroom becomes the nursery, the study, the workhouse.  The home becomes the tomb.  
But this should not be taken for proof that women are second-class citizens.  It should be taken as proof that they are first-class citizens.  And that is why women have always been here, and still  are here, defending and expanding the medieval bond  and the patriarchal family.  
The modern woman isant of the S. W. media is a typical example.  She is not here to take away our patriarchal bond, but to keep  it up for her own children. Her task is to increase it for  ourselves and our children.  
The modem ideal of marriage is this: that is to say,  the couple lives together to serve each other; but the couple  does not live together to serve each other. Instead the couple  separates to take up arms against the sort of people who have taken away  our bonds. The couple marries to have children; and the couple  marries to have children widely. Instead of a pair of plump  cherubs playing together in the sunshine, the couple will marry  to be more widely separated. Instead of a plump babe sleeping  on each other's bosoms, the couple will marry to be more widely  separated from one another.  
The further we get from this, the truer the vision of marriage,  of which I have told you this, the truer it is that I am an illusion.  I say this because it is the only vision which can explain why so many a woman  in all parts of the world has withstood the strong efforts of this  modern science to split her up into two separate, harsh, purposeless,  purposeless things; why so many a people throughout the ages,  India and Rome and modem Egypt and modern Ethiopia, have kept together  in one house; why so many a people in all parts of the world,  except Germany, except the sexless sexless Christianity  of Luther and Calvin, have kept together in one home; why  so many a people throughout the ages, except the nomadic tribes of Russia,  and especially in Siberia, except in the course of time  (for that is

The Messianic element in the story is the most subtle and difficult to understand that has ever entered in my soul. I mean that there is in that legend a hint of the Incarnation, as much a part of it as that part about the eagle and the virgin. The idea of the deliverer from the achieved end is a play upon the root idea of the Incarnation: the idea of the one unfulfilled potentiality. Men have always had dreams about the ewe who will be the babe of God; men will of old have dreamt of the she-goat who will be the babe of Jacob. But the vision of the babe of God is a vision of the destiny of the divine person; the destiny of a human person, not of a human personage. The destiny of the divine person is unfulfilled, even when it is fulfilled. Men are not always right in their theories of human destiny; and no man is wholly right in his theory of the destiny of the divine person. But in this I have in common with many modern idealists, who attempt to revive in the destiny of man the wildest dreams of the past and to put them forward in the name of a new ideal. To-day we read of the destiny of the State coming full of the  trampled interests of dynastic privilege and creaking finance, to be nobly suborned by the preachy megaphone of economics. To-morrow we read of the destiny of the Research Institute to be saddled with the weight of  the dogmas of knowledge  
by a creedless age, to be bolstered by the thundering wheels of progress.  To-day we read of the destiny of the Medical College to be swamped  (as Shakespeare was) by the ideas of the best men, to-morrow  by the ideas of the most radical kleptocrat.  
Now I hope that those who propose these schemes will briefly and briefly  set forth what they propose, and why they propose it.  The first thing to be clearly stated is that the doctrine which this whole episode  in the Medical College has in view is one which is simple and certain;  it is that doctrine which has ever been the creed of man. The Christians  did not imagine that man would be a Calvinist or a Wagnerist;  but they thought for a brief instant after his birth that he might  be a Christian. The Lutherans did

I know that many of you will be shouting "but what about the poor children?" I am afraid that there is only one answer to that, and that is the one I have just urged as the only answer to that very important and controversial question.

Do all the poor children of England share in the misery of this unhappy world? I do not think so. I think there is one class of them which does; and that class is the poor children of England.

I am aware that some of you will cry out against my saying that the poor children of England are mere tenants. You will cry out that "holdet "is the root of all his evil." I do not think so. The root of his evil is not so much so called, as it is defined. The root of his evil is the crime of over-ownership, which I shall call, I think, the rent-chaser's wife's business.

I do not wish to be rude in expressing the amount of my own anti-tenant antagonism; but I must say that I do feel that way about the general and generally admitted opinion in London that we are in a position to do away with the modern maxim that a man must be in a man's house and generally in the way that works for him.

I do not deny that large numbers of English families live in houses which is obviously against the law; such as those condemned to tenement in the Old Testament. But I do think that large numbers of English families do live in very different and much dirtier and more oppressive ways from those indicated by the common law.

And it is with this aspect of things that I introduce into the little space I have left of written criticism one very forcible weapon--a weapon which has been ready with me for almost all the weapons--but which has been very nearly a failure--the criticism of rent.

The immediate object of this book is not at all to criticise the general state of human civilization, or even to inquire whether human things are generally good or bad. Nor is it necessary to touch on any of those subjects which my critics may suppose may be found in my book a mere attack on marriage. I only ask whether certain human things are generally done in certain human houses, and whether it is right or wrong in any of the scattered cases I give of poor women evicted from their small but very happy houses because their landlords could not

====================
The newly-appointed secretary of defence, Sir Michael Fallon, has admitted that the government has failed to get the words "we can" out of the annual defence white paper.

The paper, to which Sir Michael is responsible, is the product of years of work by the MoD's thinking arms, the Royal Navy. It is not a manifesto, as the Daily Mail has claimed, but a detailed analysis of the future of the country.

It is a detailed attempt to plan for the future, with all its many and sundry problems of weather and hail.

Under the title "The General Future" it says this about the future of the country, as covered in the past, in the following chronological order:

The Industrial Revolution, or the increase of the number of wage-earners

The Industrial Revolutions (the French call them "neigbours") of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, (which in the main revealed the same truth as the Industrial Revolutions of the last half century),

The opening decades of the nineteenth century,

The closing decades of the twentieth century,

The last decades of the last centuries of the past,

The end of the nineteenth century, or the end of the English working class.

The first half of the twentieth century, when the Industrial Revolution has almost certainly begun to take its course, is the other half of the present, when the future is open to the Future. Mr Shaw (in "The Peculiar Institution") speaks of a "fourth industrial revolution", which may easily be traced to the last half century. Mr Belloc (in "The Spirit of the Age") speaks of "a third industrial revolution". Mr Hoare (in "The Age of the Small) speaks of a two- or even a one-half-dozen-year age of the national life. All speak of a "third industrial revolution" or "third age of the Englishman." "The Spirit of the Age" is certainly the older of the two, in that it is a little more practical; but it is also, I think, the more religious, the more realistic, the more candid in its recognition of the special position of the working class in the new social order. Mr Belloc does not, in the main, talk of a "third age"; and "The Spirit of the Age" does not, in the main, talk of a "third age
====================
A few years ago, I got a call from a man who thought that the word "marriage" was an obscenity, and who would do all in his power to introduce an obscenity, the word "purity" . . .

E.g. " The modern marriage test is nothing more than the old marriage certificate exercise for unmarried people who want to be married." "The modern marriage test" is the very word of the modern marriage test.

Thus the modern marriage test is nothing more than the old marriage certificate exercise for unmarried people who want to be married.

The modern marriage test, therefore, is nothing else than the modern (i.e. artificial) extension of the ancient (i.e. legal) purpose of limiting marriage to married people.

This, in a word, is the main feature of the modern marriage test. It is the extension of the ancient (and always forbidden) purpose of limiting marriage to married people.

It is, in a word, the very essence of the evil in the present marriage laws; the very opposite of the good they are meant to prevent.

The public debate has been all deaf and dumb about this point. Major parties have all spoken the same thing--about "equality"; "equality"; about "compatibility"; about "compatibility"; about "equality"; about "compatibility"; about "equality"; and about "marriage"; and about "men and women being exactly the same."

But little has been said at all about "equality," "equality without marriage," "equality in isolation," or, lastly, about "marriage," for the ordinary reader of this work will not meet that word in all its strangeness.

"Cast off the old constructions and ideas and try the things that are really right," is the old adage; and "try the things that are really right" is exactly the conservative and Christian method here.

We deal here with the concrete experience of life, with the practical test of sexual right and wrong. I do not deal with the narrow moral narrowness of this case, or even with the mere sexual narrowness of it. I deal with the sexual broadness of this case, because it is a case of practicality's very particular nature.

an act of violence, oppression, or tyranny

(usually in the sense of an act of violence, oppression, or tyranny)

when any part of the community is destroyed, when some poor woman, child, or slave, is left destitute without any protection or support; when some rich man or powerful nation oppresses a people for a crime he did not commit; when some class of men enslaves another class of men;

when a slaveholder rules over a slave; when a landlord over an inhabitant; when a banker over an employee; when an apothecary over a patient; when an English minister over a sovereign man; when an Irish parliament over an Irish republic; when an Italian factory-boss over an Italian citizen; when an Irish-owned paper over an Italian readership; when an Italian newspaper over an Italian truth; when an Italian restaurant-owner over an Italian customer; when an Italian newspaper proprietor over an Italian worker, or an Italian restaurant-owner over an Italian customer and server; when an Italian banking house over an Italian client; when an Italian S. & P. over an American cash.

when any section of a people is ruined, when one section is driven into unemployment, or slavery, or other degradation; when one section is exasperated to such excesses, as the railway men being perpetually driven from their banks, or the lumbering tavern-keepers from their districts; when one section is exasperated to such excesses, as the poor bequeathing of a dish or two of meat to a travelling preacher, or a dish or two of meat to a poor travelling preacher--when, in short, one section is exasperated to such an excess, as the ancient enemies being compelled to living together in one house by the act of a single house; when one section is exasperated to such an excess, as the old enemies bequeathing a golden calf, or a golden calf bequeathing a golden calf, being obliged to feed on each other's flesh and blood, being driven together by the cold realities of the modern world; when one section is exasperated to such an excess, as the animal enemies bequeathing a life of labor, with no more life in common, with no more labor in common, to a new life of servitude, with no more servitude in common, to a life of bondage; when, in short, one section has to face

The ultimate goal of the Muslim Brotherhood and the broader Middle East rebellion against the West is a return to what it calls the "lesser darkness," to the "dark ages" of the Crusades and the Inquisition. The world must be saved by the Franks, the world must be saved by the Latin Church. The world must be saved by a small band of Christian warriors who have conquered a pagan people and restored true Christianity.

This is the idea behind the Middle East revolt, the vision that for fifty years has swept this land. It is the vision of a people who have been driven from their homes, who have been terrorized and persecuted by this brutal and rapacious international business man, and who now see in the cold glare of his gigantic red and white flag the only expression of their unshakable faith in a new and nobler age.

This is the vision that finds expression not only in the red flag which the people of the Holy Land have flown, but in the golden rule of Islam, the golden rule which says that the closer a man looks for the divine the more likely he is to find it.

This is the vision that finds expression, it will be remembered, in the colossal edifice that is the United Nations. This is the international tribunal of last resort, the last bulwark of human civilization against mad pagan powers and final interferences from the black abyss beyond the stars.

This is the vision that finds expression, in the speech of Sixtus V at the dedication of the Tropic of Cancer, in which, in praise of the universal responsibility of nations and in praise of the necessity of a just system of punishments for the offence of a few, he speaks of "a world without a plutocracy, a world without a rich man, and a world without slums." And this is the vision that finds its most emphatic expression in the resolution of the United Nations, seconded by the veto of France, in regard to a proposal to make it a law that a man in a brothel shall be put out of the common-law by the lawful authority of every respectable brothel.

It is this second vision that has excited our attention in this controversial chapter of our history, and especially in that section of it in which we have concentrated ourselves absolutely without result. It is this vision of the first importance, that the general idea of the world may not be frustrated by a few eccentric exceptions. It is
====================
I am a man of few words. I have never uttered a profligate one, and at this moment I am not even sure that a profligate word is a wise one. But even this is not to be understood as meaning that I am in favor of a system of education in which the necessary speculations are left to a specialist; where ignorance is dressed up with humility as knowledge; in which the savage code of life is concealed from the brave educator in the name of specialism; where the very smell of progress excites contempt among parties that ought to be friendly. I fear rather that I am in favor of a system of education in which the very smell of specialism excites emulation. It is enough for me to know that people who excel at anything can do it if they want to; that a man can learn almost anything if given the opportunity. I do not deny that an education is necessary for all human growth; and indeed I am in favor of a system of education which may well be called educational, since it helps humanity as a whole. But I do not think it desirable at this moment, or any moment soon, to-

p. 548 VILFREDO ZARTAROV offers, because of the present social problems, that the economic advantages of this present educational system should be concealed in the obscenity of a sentimental or theological creed. I therefore question whether it is not waywardly expedient that there should never be an educational system in the first place? It is an established fact that where there is a market there shall be an educator. If there is not a market for teachers there shall be none for pupils. If there is not a market for institutes of higher learning there shall be none for young people. There is no question about it. The only question is how to market it. The only question which really interests me is this: whether there shall yet be any men left alive who do not think that this modern miracle which has just taken place on this earth can ever again be accomplished in such simple, if harsh, and tidy, and pastoral terms in the old and familiar ways of the earth. III The Future of Things There is one thing which troubles me exceedingly in the present epoch, and this is that many men, however well meaning, however sincere, however sincere in heart, nevertheless take it for granted that things must be done in a certain way, and in that particular way. They say that men

You need not be a specialist in a field to understand the joy of the mannequin. The picture of the modern housewife, the picture that flits about the streets and the pages of the newspapers, has taken from the artist a morbid glamour and narrowed his vision to a single human ideal. The artist has left behind him a bewildering maze of morbid details. He has taken from him a coarse coat, a coarse hat, a coarse frockcoat, a coarse coat-of-arms, a coarse pedigree, a coarse drawing-room section, and has called it home comfort and family feasting. All these are scattered about the abode, like dead flowers, in the shape of holidays, banquets, banquets of wines and cigars, banquets of presents, banquets of presents renewed, banquets of cigars, banquets of cigars, and so on. These things have assumed a life of their own and become encyclopedias of the past. Meanwhile the artist has lost his way among the living flowers of the present. He has turned to the grotesque and grotesque has turned to the living dead. He has lost the dead flower for a living flower. The mannequin is a splendid model for the savage, for the sociologist is likely to be excellent friends with the anthropologist, on the whole, on the score that the anthropologist can use the model on an exact scientific basis, whereas theologists can use them on an artistic basis. But the mannequin is also a living example of the first effect of which I have spoken, the effect of a departure from the central ideal. The mannequin is not a complete substitute for the ideal, but it is a very superficial and superficial substitute indeed; it is not a complete ideal. It is a very crude model, like that of the eighteenth century flute-maker, showing us the outline of a trifle, but not showing us what it is. It is a map of the future, like that of the seventeenth century map-maker, but it is only a map of the past, showing us the road not taken. It is, perhaps, the nearest we can come to describing the state of the human imagination after the twelfth century revival which discovered the complete picture of the divine city to be contained in the Garden of Eden. About this time a huge public sale took place all round the world. Everybody bought a copy of a little book,
====================
And what about the second proposition, that the married state is a better arrangement than the monasterial state? Why, I should say that the two arrangements have very nearly the same positive reasons for existing. The one is practical and the other moral; it is a practical expedient to avoid the horrible punishments of religious life, and it is a moral expediency. The other ideal is vague, idealized, and even perverted; it is never, in the main, a moral expediency; and it is because the one is practical that it never becomes a practical fact. That which is not a question of fact can never be a guide or a model. That which is can never be a model. That which is can only be a guide or a model, a mirror to which to point when we are in doubt. That which is can only be a guide or a model, a guide which leads us on to the narrower path of lessening the more. I have said in the past that in morals the ideal is not the perfect man, but rather that which is imperfect. That is the only adequate way of putting my position. There are certain gigantic moral problems which cannot in any wise be dealt with in terms of giant men. There are many such gigantic problems as can be dealt with in terms of many giant tools; such as economics, education, hygiene, labor, politics, peace, and the rest. Those which cannot be dealt with in terms of these, such as the ultimate end of labor, are outside of the special powers of my special system. But even there the special proposition is self-evident. In ethics the ideal man is the quintessence of manhood; the thing that makes up the center of a civilization. He is the ideal man if he is imaginative, hard-working, self-reliant, self-controlled, self-sacrificing, self-reliant upon nature for his soul--the soul of humanity. Now in many fields of life the ideal man has become a fetter which separates the ideal man from the realities of life. He is not found mainly in the home; he is found in the factory, in the jail, in the dungeon. He is not found at the bar; he is found at the well. He is found rather scattered about the earth, and left to wander aimless and alone among the materials which men have given it. He is not found at the farm; he is found in the
====================
More than a year ago I wrote about a talk I gave on "The Making of a Feminist" at the fourth annual women's retreat at the lovely House of Fraser, in Sussex.

In it I told the story of how my aunt, the duke of Norfolk, a man of great learning, of an impressive and powerful house, of a house which she had seen and loved and shared with many a duke and marquis, she had decided that she would make her own house. And yet she was taken in by a man she does not like, and is driven gently from her home.

There is a further layer of complexity which is not even mentioned by name in the opening explanation. But I think it worth while to mention it, because it is at the root of a further complication that is pretty much a ceaseless headache to modern idealists.

In the abstract scheme of things, it is true that a woman can do many things a man cannot do. She can ride a mare, for one thing; and she certainly was allowed to ride a mare (even though Mr. Blatchford thought it too heavy) by the Queen who was her sovereign. (There is every reason to suppose that the Duke of Norfolk, though a mare-rider, was also a hunter and a pirate.) Mr. Quelch, in urging my removal from that splendid stable of masculine conventions, the masculine horse, has managed quite fraudulously to confound the mere fact that a mare can go by me and by her, while a man can go by her and by her husband.

But there is an even more intimate and much more important fact to be noted in the matter. Mr. Quelch has managed quite fraudulously to confound the mere fact that a mare can go by me and by a horse, by this very mare, in the words of one of his leading critics.

I am told that mules go by men, but that I am not quite clear on the point. I understand Mr. Quelch to mean that a mule goes by a man merely on account of the man on the animal. I understand him to mean that a mule goes by a man largely on account of the mule on the animal, partly on account of the horse on the animal, partly on account of the man on the mule. But I do not quite understand him to understand that a

"They were seriously looking forward to the day when they would have something to eat and a fire to keep them warm."

--H. L. Mencken, "The Open House" (1868)

And now, (presumably, to the end of the missive, with a little quip about how far the missive went), it is necessary to say a few words about the date and the subject of this paper.  I have thought it my duty to the silent class, to have dwelt in a world where things  are openly spoken, not in a world where they are concealed.  In the words of Burke: "If you are going to be a Member of Parliament,  get over concealing and holding things to be the truth."  I have dwelt, not in fairy tales, but in actual fact, in the truth  of the working week as a fixed rule of the trade.  
On the twenty-fifth of the month of December, workingmen in almost all  English cities take to the air to demand twelve-hour days; they gather  outside City clubs and Railway stations to give vent to their feelings;  on the one side are the police and employers, who are enraged;  on the other, the strikers, who are in a dilemma.  
The P. M.S. is triumphant; the employers are in a daze;  the workers are in a panic. The truth is this:  that both classes have bled to death; the huge minority who  refused to be ruled by the law and the tiny minority who governed from  on high, and therefore are both justified and indebted for their  names and pensions.  
The working class has indeed made a fatal blunder; it has followed a path  too far-sighted to be the child's path; it has been the revolutionary  path of the day. It has stood for what is no longer-what  is not--but it has also supported what is too soon.  The P. M.S. has trampled all over the workers; the employers have  stampeded, the press denounced, and the P. M.S. has persisted in defending  what was once only P. M.S.

====================
  Private individuals may design and construct any machine that can be found  and that works; machines that work for themselves and for others.  In the same way the people of the future may be any people they choose.  They may be industrial democracies, like Britain or Germany, or mercantilist  democracies, like Japan or Taiwan. They may be  free nations, like the United States or Canada; or they may be nations,  like the Japanese or the Taiwanese. There may be only a few big families;  or there may be millions of us; as therefore the United States  can be, or was, or may be. America has never been a nation of only  a few huge families; it is a nation of all the middle classes.  The Rockefellers are not only American aristocrats, but they are  also Americans of European and Asian extraction, like the Rothschilds.  This makes them Americans of all nations; that is, American  not only of the rich but of the rest of us as well.  No more will I need to be rich to be American; I only need to be  European to be American. The industrial revolution has made  for itself the official epithet of the justly successful citizen  and citizen-at-large system, the idea that in a free  and equal society the citizen and the people should rule.  The largest and best-off citizens will be the new officers in the cause  of truth, justice, and freedom of the nation.  
It is by no means necessary to this broad reconstruction  of our political ideals that I mean, so far as possible,  to show that they are by no means inevitable. The theories  may be as old as the universe, as elementary or as  mystical as your own youth or failing moment. The only thing  which is new is that some of the bigots have lost their jobs.  The creationism movement, which used to have a fine argument  in its own newspaper, is now engaged in writing a best- 
seller recommending creationism, a stupid and actually  anti-Semitic theory whose only support can be found in the darkest corners of  the Internet. Theistic evolutionists keep a regular  company in their new pulpits, but they use all the same  words to one another in a thicket full of interpolated  lies.

In the nine months since he took office, the son of a retired general has destroyed the very idea of citizenship in America by gutting the social safety net. He has gutted the very idea of equality in America by gutting the social safety net. He has gutted the very idea of citizenship in a gutless and gutsy act of cynicism.

--George Santayana, "The War on the English Speaking Church"

Our national conversation is so tediously and exhaustively defined that there is not the least probability that any man or divinity is mentioned more than once. There is, however, a third class of abstract ideas that are not defined, but which the mind does get defined upon. These are the feebler, shapeless, and ever-shifting ones, the things that happen to men over time and in various environments and under various kinds of ands or evil governments and other such ands. Two of these are already here to narrate the current of our conversation; the second one is "The Waste Land" and it is called "The Day After" by the men of the Conservative Revolution.

The first of these is the day after, which is a type of day. A man may have an ordinary ordinary ordinary ordinary day; that is, he does not sleep, he does not dream, and he does not remember anything unpleasant he did last Friday or the Friday preceding it. This is the ordinary day after the Friday after the Friday. As a rule, the people who hold public office in this country are not the worst types of human destiny. Nearly all of the bright and prosperous men of the past, men like Milner, Marshall, and Harcourt, were born on a Friday. We all were born on a Friday; it is the great British birthmark. The only people who are less likely to find public office in the course of a century or two is people of fairy-landy birth.

Men of the past who have not children generally have not lived in the past; and the millions of people who have lived in modern towns and cities all through the nineteenth century or of the last century, they are convinced that they lived in the past. They look back upon their youth with a

When I was in high school, the word "sociopath" was in vogue. Now we call him a "social constructivist." 
The sociologist does not call a man by his first four letters,  does he? He calls him by his face and his manner of life.  
When people say that people like to be governed,  
I answer that they say people like to be governed, but only  in the sense in which one would like to be washed.  It is very hard to govern when nobody but yourself is governed.  Except in the sense in which one would like to be governed,  not being governed, not being governed,  
of course it is hard to govern. But it is also quite plain  that the word "sociopathic" (as I prefer to say)  is used in the wrong sense. It is used in the sense  of the correct and charmingly ironic nickname given  to a certain type of woman: the parlor hostess.  
Not all politicians are as sociable and entertaining as parlor hosts  are politicians. A little politeness goes a long way.  
The word "sociopathic" (like all the others) is a misleading  and misleading kind of corruption. It is really a kind of  
transmission, the taking in of which has never been taken in the race.  The transmission of a poison is always sexual; a poison  is never sexual. It is always transmitted by word of word  or image of word, so that the first man to drink from the well  will kill his brother the second man to drink from the well  will not only honor and please him,  
but love and please them as well. And the problem is, What is  the deep and secret fire in these things? It is not some  sentimental love of power or submission; it is a love of power and  submission, a hunger for ideals unshaken. It is really  about an unprecedented degree of objectivism, about an unprecedented  intensity of satisfaction in the discovery  of new uglies. It is really  
about the discovery of the last unknown.

The world of media has created a world of idiots. The media, for all their omniscience and omnipotence, are a highly human creation. They are made up of people who had better be made to be a little more sane. It is not merely true that the modern workingman is much fitter for the Roustabout than the olden monastic walk; it is also true, further, that the modern intellectual is much fitter for the Roustabout than the olden intellectual walk; that the intellectual walk, so far from serving the soul better than either the bodily or the intellectual walk, in fact seems to be serving the soul worse. To get up every morning one has made a walk for idiots; an endless row of boxes, each with a typewriter and a pencil-sharpener, along a narrow path which, at the end, leads to a dark little theater.

The M. B.A. does not mean that one should forget the people. One knows one's teachers even if one does not know his name. But one must also think of one's teachers.

I am not so ready with the professor who will say that he does not know his students because they have all gone to the Institution. I am ready, if necessary, to knock him down. One knows one's friends even if one does not know one's number. 
I remember that an old man taught that school life was lonely and one had only one friend;  that is, one was supposed to be a m. bourgeois. Now I remember that a school boy once told me that he knew his friends even  if he does not know his number. I am ready to knock a man if he is not ready to knock his son.  I am not so ready to knock a man if he is not ready to knock his son.  I remember that an old man taught that school life was lonely and one had only one  companion; now I remember that he knows his companions even if he does not remember them.  I knock at the door of a man's house, not because I am knocking at the door  of some mad mysticism, but because I knock at the door of a shop.  I remember that a man had said that a man should have companions;  now I say that a man should have friends.

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has been accused of being a "persecution factory" after it was revealed that at least 5,000 children have been made to watch a version of "The Da Vinci Code" or "Titanic" on a daily basis.

The revelations come as a class action is expected to challenge the way in which the original five children who created the modern world are being immortalized in bronze and glass.

In the process of making the public believe that the lives of women are merely the perpetual details of advertisements, the mediaeval world is being slowly turned into a world of its own.

The mediaeval world is being slowly turned into a world of its own. This is the story of how a small-town high-jacked, rolled up, and cast into the seaside seaside of Norfolk, with all the ugliness of a Spanish court, and with all the ugliness of the slave trade.

A London flat-mate with whom I have shared very small rooms, assured me that he did not think I was a "dumb woman," but merely an old woman who had been living at the seaside and had had it taken away by a younger woman. I will not now go so far as to say that I share her opinion. I only say that, in a peculiar way, I share it also, that is, I share it with the young, who are now apparently not young at all, and I do not share my share of the old woman's disgust.

In any case, I am of the opinion that the sensible thing to do is to cast these things out of view; that "The Da Vinci Code" might be rendered "The Innocence of Hungry Women," "The Titanic" might be rendered "The Tragedy of the Young." "Titanic"  would be "The Tragedy of the Young" and "The Divine Comrades" "The Da Vinci Code" would  be "The Divine Comrades." "The Titanic" might be rendered "The  Commute to the Office." And if any one rebukes you for this view,  you may go and cast the old woman out of your sight, that she might live on.  Or perhaps you can cast her out of your sight by throwing out the truck stop.  That is the position I took, and that is
====================
A man who has never handed over his beer can be forgiven for thinking that he is living in a different world from that of the beer gatherers of yore. The word "pub" has lost all color in these days. A tavern in a tavern adorns every omnibus and omnibus suburb. Bus stops are like beer gardens. Hotels are like beer gardens.

In this world of beer salesmen, there is only one man who should be called the beer gatherer. He is the man among us called the great-grandson of the beer gatherer. He is Mr. William Morris, of Morris and Dorset.

For nearly a century now our great-grandfather has been telling us that the growth of our industry and commerce has been rapid and splendidly fulfilled by a comparatively few men who called themselves beer gatherers. Mr. Morris, they say, is the grandson of a beer-gatherer. I do not remember exactly where this ridiculous story was first told; it may have been in a newspaper, or it may have been in a little children's book. But at any rate it is absurd, and our grandfather, the great-grandson of a beer-gatherer, is the exponent of it.

Of course, I do not agree with the great grandfather theory, and I should take it very seriously indeed, if I did not take it very seriously indeed. I would take the theory with a healthy dose of skepticism if I were under any circumstances prepared to swallow a healthy dose of skepticism. I am not seriously skeptical about the past, and I am not seriously skeptical about the future. I take the former seriously because history is history; and because, though it has its vicissitudes, it always ends. The other half of my brain, which might be called the bodily side of my head, would normally do just the opposite, if it could. My bodily side would be quite happy if I did not deal with the future,

but the mental side of the question says: "What shall we do now? What shall we try now? What shall we endure now?" Mr. Morris may be a beer-gatherer; but he is certainly a man of action. And he says that the growth of our industry and commerce has been veryply fulfilled by a comparatively few men who call themselves beer gatherers.

And therefore, young man, I offer here

====================
If you have a simple model of human thought, then a man is free to suppose anything he wishes, to argue anything he likes, to design anything he likes, to doubt anything he likes, to deny anything he likes, if he likes. But if you have a complex, rational, social, felt, moral, and social thought, then (except in the extreme cases) you must submit to arbitrary rules, including those of the gods.

There are only two possible solutions to this difficulty; one is a return to the old Greek ideal of a soul that is the center and center of the whole. The other is to return to the original meaning of the word liberty, which is only a fancy title given to a certain freedom.

In the first place, I answer that there can be no other definition of liberty, consistent with the existing intellect and practical experience, than that which contains within its precise and measurable limits a recognition of the dignity of each human being as the center and center of his community; that this recognition is a freedom, not a slavery; that for a properly conceived and exercised freedom there is no other formula than that of the common good; and that in the practical and imaginative application of this freedom, there can be no other standard than the legal standard or the good of the time.

This is the only possible and adequate definition of the essential dignity of each human being; and I therefore adopt it, with the significant additions that older and older thinkers have added, and that the contemporary humanists may add, of their own making.

The first point to be noted is this: that the complete and conscious self-government of man consists in the recognition by him of the special dignity of each of his members as a center, as a point of potentiality, as a point of movement or resting-place or receptacle for the life of the community. That which is central to the life of a community is the home or home of the community. If the things that are central to the life of a community are sex and property, then the things that are central to the home are the home and the community. If the things that are central to the home are thrift and thriftfulness, then the things that are central to the home are the home and thrift. But these things are not central to the life of the community; they do not even begin to cover it.

Men have often forgotten that a community is a
====================
The purpose of this section, then, is not simply to point out the peculiar machinery of recent English history, but to trace the steps that have been taken to restore that machinery. The system has undergone two complete revolutions in the last thirty years. Our fathers did not restore the spelling law, as they did the army and navy. On the whole, their system was a little more liberal than ours, because it was representative; it did not protect the poor as we did the empire. They did, indeed, preserve for posterity the spelling law as a mere relic of a bygone age; but they did not preserve it as a relic of a bygone age either. The educationists of our time restore the empire, not merely to show that they are good men, but also that they were good men a long time ago. They restore the empire not merely to give a pleasing picture of a free and democratic age, but also to give a pleasing picture of a gold-plated age. They restore it to convince the world that England was a virtue above all the good citizenship of the eighteenth century, that she is a just world beyond all the good citizenship of the nineteenth century. Their whole business in the matter is self-promotion and the illusion of protection. They tell a good many poor children in this country that, in a few short centuries, the world will no longer care what the world is made of, or what the winds blow on. They tell one child in this country that the world is going to bow to nothing but milk and honey any day now. This is the main and only object of the educationist machinery. It is a religion, and the better to convince its worshippers of the sincerity of its faith. I do not say that the world is easy for the educationists; but I say that it is not so bad a playground for it. The hard part is that the hard part is a business. The hard part for them is not the difficult part, but the rather more difficult but more valuable but more troubling part of not having any ideas at all. I do not deny that there are difficult and difficult task in life. I merely deny that the educationist must submit to them. He only has to face them, for he is a real man. He has to deal with them head on; he has to face the fact that his opponents will offer any number of things to destroy his system, even if these proposals be fully congruous with

' The King's English, ' says Mr. Bernard Shaw, was the rule, not the exception, in eighteenth-century education, and that the only difference between it and that of the present day was the system of headmasters and schools. This is truly an arresting statement of our situation. Not a marked instance of aristocracy exists in modern times; aristocracy exists in the most brutal and the most baneful forms; and the aristocracy of the seventeenth century and the aristocracy of the eighteenth existed not in the sense of strict equality, as we understand it, but of an aristocracy of the very best. The head of a private house-  maintained in this way, whether noble or ignoble, meant something special. Mr. Herbert Johnson, the regent of Somerset, might be said to mean something special; and indeed, indeed, every English house-  headmaster has to mean something special. Mr. Johnson might indeed be regarded as setting out to be Mr. Johnson; but his Plan  of the House of Commons must be regarded as a more or less full and successful attempt to set out to be

Mr. Bernard Shaw really does attack this extraordinary position, that in our

household-keeping there is a sort of competitive struggle, a sort of assize, like that of the private soldiers.  There is a sort of long knife that must be cut in the morning and kept on in the evening,  so that the long knife may be sharpened and the short knife (or dagger) hidden.  The head of a private house must not only be strong in body and mind; it must  also be strong in business. No one has ever owned that more  than the king or queen. Private houses cannot possibly be as wealthy  as public houses; but the king's was certainly more powerful than  the queen's. Private houses are not oligopolies; they are not 
financial oligopolies. Mr. Bernard Shaw really means by oligopolies the art  of limiting the acquisition of too much by the take and by the take by the take . . .too little.  A man may own all the canaries of the earth, but he must not own them all. To prevent a man from having all the economists of the world,  all the political scientists of the world, he must not be a member  of the great two hundred and one per cent. club.

The search is on for a new keeper after the disastrous performance of David James. James, the man who put Michael Owen in charge of Crystal Palace, collapsed on the job in disgrace and resigned due to the pressure of "too much mediaeval publicity and club unity."

*

James's case is instructive as a test of the modern theory that the mass of the people is better managed by separating the social from the private concerns than by coming to the surface of them all. But it is not a case of separating the social from the private. Both are at the heart of the matter. The trouble is that a great part of the social-minded class in our time (I do not say all the class, only the class) has done the very thing that should separate the social-minded class and has done so in ways that are at once autocratic and autocraticist. It has done what is called the Brando thing, which is to have one's life's work depicted in pictures.

The moderns all shout "Vive Laize Purée," but the truth is that they shout "Vive Laize Manners." Many a girl in a crowd of fifty has a fixed idea about the one splendid quality in her own pure self, and this almost always has no precedent in fact or factotyramousity in art. She is known by no such thing as thrift; and this almost always happens when she is twenty or thirty, when the world is still more hoar than she is free. The thing about thrift, which we will return to, is that it comes into its own when it is employed for the very thing it is intended to prevent.

The modern, on the other hand, when he has got to be creative, has none of these four qualities, and uses them for self-promotion. She thinks thrift is only to be used as a club for silk; but it is really to be used as a club for silk; for the more she uses it, the more she finds silk in it. She thinks modesty is only to be used for a waistcoat; but it is really to be used for anything, even a waistcoat. And this has produced some of the most delightful women in the world.

Now the modern instinct in all this is exactly this mediaeval: it is autocratic. It wants something for nothing. It would be quite happy to have

is simply this: that in the modern world there is no world.  There is only this: we, the  moderns, are trying to make this world.

In brief, I built a modern man's world.  
It is not so much that I built a modern house;  it is rather that I (a man) built a modern house.  I built a house, as everyone of you will agree, because it  is beautiful. It is not, as some have supposed, that I built a house because it  is beautiful; it is not even that simple. I did not build a house because it  is beautiful merely because it is warm; I did not do it because it is  beautiful because it is hot, I did it because it is beautiful because it  is splendid. I did not construct a house, merely because it is  large; I did so, so far, simply on account of its grandeur,  that it excited our magnanimous creator to the utmost.  The house was not so much enormous in its design as extremely gigantic;  in that it was so small within; for the very fact that it was  enormous made it very small in the eyes of so many millions of the people  of the world. And because the world was international,  the house was international also, and international even in its inversion.  Because it was international, international sentiment ran riot in its praise,  tearing at the very pretensions of the republican form of government.  The press was carried away with tales of the magnificence of the Italian,  the splendor of the Greek, the incestuousity of the Roman, the extent  of the tombs of Pericles and Tutankhamen. The essays  in leading newspapers were devoted in their praises to the Pesto  of Tutankhamen and the Black Plague of Pacha I think  is

But poor in that of prejudice, or of trickery. Such is the analogy which has guided my discussion of this question. Suffice it to say here that I am not proposing to suggest a theory of morals; that is the province of sociology. Rather, I am proposing to suggest a method of judging morals, or, at least, of classifying them, such as is expedient to me. There is, perhaps, but one case on earth where this plan can be fully successfully carried out ; and that is in the case of this special morbid and morbidly sentimental sex, the problem of which is specially female. I will take, as a guide, a few verses from the new edition of Mrs. Dalloway's ' Humourismo-Criticismo ' by the artist and humorous woman Miss Pankhurst. "Humour," say she, "is the only science consistent with the future." "But only in the future," answer our opponents, "it is always criticiquing the past!" "Well," say they, "criticism is never direct; it only proceeds from the past." "Exactly," say they, "but criticism always returns to the truth, since it began." "But how can it be a direct quotation from the past," ask they, "when it is a whole system from the present?" "Because criticism is a systematized statement of a truth," reply our opponents. "Because a system is a collective statement, it is also a statement of a truer truth." "But a statement cannot be a statement of a truer truth," say they. "It is simply false if and when it is said." "But a statement of a truth is a statement of a more perfect truth," reply our opponents. "It is simply false if and when it is said." "But history is no more a statement of a truer truth than poetry is a statement of a more perfect song," say they. "History is a mere collection of tales told in rhyme," say they.

Now, in their mad worship of efficiency and neatness,  they forget that the body and soul of a house are the people  who inhabit it. People move about it; people are caressed;  people talk about it.

We know that Shakespeare wrote the best plays, and that he wrote the most brilliant plays. But how far must the finest gold be the gold of the roses?

His plays are stunning because their denizens are repulsive and their denizens immortal. A certain despicable peasant in the tragedy is a model of uprightness and a model of sanctity. The only element that could possibly co-operate with the evil aspect of the peasant in Romeo and Juliet is that good peasantess we have just met: the wife of the peasant. The peasant in our story is Meryton, the most unutterable monster of the play.

Meryton is the thing in the tragedy; he is the extreme version of the human being. He is the hero who marries the setting sun, but who later burns his hat in the church, for the same reason that a man might later marry the stars. (If a man marries an ugly woman, he may marry a pretty woman also if he likes; if he marries a beautiful woman, she also may marry him if she likes; and so on forever, forever and ever, until she meets a ripe old woman with the stars in between the two of them, and says to her, "Now you are truly beautiful that way.") We meet the hideous embodiment of lust in the monster in the play as well as in the original. The original monster was a hero, not of lust, but of justice; the monster in the play is not a hero at all, but a common man, a man to be pitied, a man to please.

Meryton is the embodiment of the good in our story. He is the monster because he is a plaything. He is the plaything because he is a sacrifice. He is the sacrifice because he is a bird, and the bird is the only thing that can pierce him. He is the sacrifice, for he is a work, and the only workable work is death.

"Our efforts to create the most comprehensive and effective education system in the world have not been without difficulties and disappointments. But we have never lost sight of the great truth that education is education, and that the best way to the goal we have set is to set the goal before us. It is in that open and frank way that the educator is most fully and most resolutely responsible. He is the one who gives the child his sense of right and wrong, honor and disgrace; it is he who raises the standard of manhood and womanhood in the fierce marketplace of Nature."--John Dewey.

The peculiar responsibility of school boards has been made all the more clear by the way in which  they are now confronted with the task of opening the way to the economy of life  in the future. The history of free education in this country has  been a history of attacks on it. The attack was made in part by the English aristocrats,  who regarded it as a fetter on liberty; but it was made all the more  unbearable by the English proletariat, who saw in it an attempt at  spiritual and even racial revival. In this century the English education  (and in this we may safely add the attack) are again affirming their  English kinship by affirming the attack. The Education Act (so far as it is  being attempted) is a reversion to the worst elements of the past.  It is a sort of Puritan revivalism, an attack on the Elizabethan education  as much for Puritan purposes as for educational purposes.  
The decisive battle was not about the qualities of education, but  about the amount of education. That is what has been decided.  The choice is between a sort of Puritan revivalism of the worst  and broadestest descriptions, or a choice between a highly technical  and narrowest definitions of education and between state control and  education by compulsory education. The choice is between  a highly technical and narrow definition of manhood and womanhood,  between a mild andillinism of the older schools and a cruel  strictivism of the present schools. The choice must  be clear

Glad you've made up your minds about the question. Now it's time to admit that it doesn't really happen all that much any more, and to ask

in what direction to direct our energies.

I have often thought of the case of the woman organiser.

I mean that I have often thought of the case of the high official who puts on a fly-dress and

appears at an all-women's feasting, only to have the hostesses insist that she should remain a man.

I have often thought of the case of the beadle who has to attend a female education

and then finds that the children do not learn as well as they used to do,

or even like as well.

And I have often thought of the case of the female officer in a man's army.

I mean that I have often thought of the case of the case of the only woman who has ever really done it.

There was the old story, told not long ago, of a woman gunnering at a raid and being

shaken to hear that the men were getting tired of them.

There was the more recent (in memory and prominence) of a story told

not long since that the women were gunning and she was just

dropping to the ground to get a good shot at them.

Now, if I ask you what you think ought to be the general aim of women in this field, I

guess you will probably answer that the women should try to do everything men have done before them, or that

they ought to try to do everything that men have tried before them.

====================
There has always been a sort of wicked irony in the fact that evil men have always found means of successfully preventing the realization of their schemes, while at the same time they have always been ready to offer ready-made means for their schemes. Men always find some means that works; they always find some way that fools with. The only difference is that the modern fool is always a specialist, whereas the ancient fool was always a commoner. Mr. Bernard Shaw is as common a fool as it is possible to make; but he is a much fitter and happier fool, because of it.

It is true of schemes as well as of means. The first means that will do is strength, the last, that will do. The means are as fluid and mutable in a government whose strength is unlimited as in one whose weakness is fixed. Mr. Chamberlain, for instance, might have called on the Lord Chancellor, Lord Rosebery, for the Major-General, the Duke of Sussex for the Duke of Sussex. Mr. Chamberlain might even have called on the Earl of Sussex for the Earl of Sussex. Mr. Chamberlain might even have called on the Earl of Sussex for Mr. Chamberlain, or Mr. Earl of Sussex for Mr. Chamberlain. Mr. Chamberlain might even have called on the Earl of Sussex for the Earl of Sussex. Mr. Chamberlain might even have called on the Earl of Sussex for Mr. Chamberlain, or Mr. Earl of Sussex for Mr. Chamberlain. The only fixed point about these international plays is that the play has to be continued at all.

But the same element appears in all those schemes for the creation of conditions unconnected with the individual that are so much the work of passion, intrigue, and subterfuge. These must first be anti-social schemes, for they cannot operate spontaneously; they must first be anti-sensible. Mr. Cadbury, for instance, could only hope to obtain from Mr. Chamberlain the anti-social scheme of the new General Election. But Cadbury could only ask Mr. Chamberlain to leave the old Parliament House in which it now happens to be housed; Cadbury in the new House, and Parliament in the future Parliament. In short, Mr. Cadbury had to ask one thing after the other in an attempt to get one thing out of Mr. Chamberlain. Mr. Cadbury might even have asked one thing after the other after these very same things, in an attempt to get one thing out of

Our friends at the Atlantic thought I outed my wife on their website (which is a little odd, actually; I suppose it is the peculiar quality of the modern website), and since then she's come out and said all kinds of things that I (or anyone for that matter) thought were just lies. I mean, seriously, I told her so.

And now, ladies and gentleman, for the sake of argument, I say she's outed on our website.

Our friends at the Atlantic decided that it was worth while to offer a forum for all the woman haters out there to spout their hatreds. And in the process, they created this:

And here it is, ladies and gentlemen, in all its loathsome glory:

In case you missed it, the person most responsible for the creation of the word "hateful" is, of course, the same person who created the word "sick." It is the same anonymous person who gave us the name "misogynist" (which is strangely not "misogynist" at all)--

and who also gave us the pejorative word "transphobe" (which is very strange indeed).

And now, ladies and gentlemen, the topic of this lecture is not the existence of "hateful" women; the topic of the topic of the lecture is the existence of unfaithful men.

The "hateful woman" is as different from the unfaithful man as the two lovers are from each other. There we have the object of our enmity--the very opposite of the object of our hatred. "Hateful" is a word that can mean anything; it can mean anything to the most daft of men. It can mean (as Jules Michelet so capably puts it) to be a Socialist. It can mean to be a Radical. It can mean to be a statesman. It can mean to be a Baptist. It can mean to have a farm. All it necessarily must mean is that you are a political animal of one sort or other. The point is that it is never easier to be a political animal than to be a wrong one.

But the modern "hateful woman" is something very different. She may be a mere statesman; she may be a mere Baptist; she may be a mere farm-boy; but if she is ever called a hateful

This past week, the state of Florida passed a law that will force any doctor who counsels a woman on whether to have an abortion to get a special state license. This is the most far-reaching and severe instance of the modern attempt to confine women to the home and childbearing. It is the attempt to destroy the home and childbearing as political and social institutions.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called it "the most severe attack on collective responsibility in history."

Dr. King said that if we permit women to vote, "we shall permit men to vote." If we permit women to own business, "we shall permit men to own business." If we permit women to own a home of our own, "we shall permit men to own a home of our own." If we permit women to own a house of our own, "we shall permit men to own a house of our own." If we permit women to own an airplane, "we shall permit men to own an airplane." We shall permit women to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, politicians, teachers, ornamists or painters. We shall permit women to become carpenters, electricians or bricklayers. We shall permit women to become geologists, painters or sculptors. We shall not permit women, in the last analysis, to be doctors, lawyers, engineers or politicians.

Dr. King was not speaking with any authority, or any authority at all. But he is certainly speaking for a great many of his people, who do not like the thought of any section of the people losing its stranglehold on the political process. And there is a strong reason for their being opposed to the thought of women holding political office, or even of women holding political office for very long.

The history of women holding political office is very long, very dotted with disappointments and very dotted with disappointments that are not really all that disappointing. Miss Pankhurst lost by a landslide. Miss Macedonia by a landslide. Miss Isham by a landslide. Miss Giffard by a landslide. Miss Giffard and Miss Giffard and Miss Giffard all lost by landslides.

And none of them was ever carried away by the feeling of accomplishment that the landslide-loss inaugurated for her. Miss Pankhurst's relief was not a feeling of complete victory; much less of complete complete victory over the enemy. Miss Macedonia's

THE BRAND NEW TOWN

On June 5, 1869, in the bleak little village of Newbury-port, twenty-three poor Calvinists (I mean the Reformed and Baptist) sat down in a little house and wrote a work of theology, called "A Preachers Bible."

The work sold for ten shillings and a half, and divided the money between the poor and rich, the middle class and the poor. "The Lord is rich," said the poor man; "and so are you." "He is poor, and we are rich." "Our Lord is rich," said the rich man, "and we are poor." "He is poor, and we are godlike," said the godlike man. "Do you think the world would be a better place if there were only ten million rich people living side by side on this earth? No; God would see to that." "Do you suppose," said the godlike men, "that ten million rich people would all sit down and have a common loaf? Lord, I pray you! I am not so sure." "Do you suppose," said the godlike men, "that ten million rich people would all dream that there was a rich man in the corner making them tea and handing them cigars? Lord, I pray you! I am not so sure." "Do you suppose," said the rich man, "that ten million rich people would all forget that their cigars are cigars and their teas are tai chi and they would all say that their cigars are stronger than the prayers of mankind? Lord, I pray you! I am not so sure." "Do you suppose," said the godlike men, "that ten million rich people would all forget that their tai chi is like a thousand trumpets playing at once, and that their tai chi was a thousand times as sweet as honey, and that their tai chi was as sweet as the honey of God? Lord, I pray you! I am not so sure." "Do you suppose," said the rich man, "that ten million rich people would all forget that their tai chi was like a hundred fiddles playing at once, and that their tai chi was a hundred times as sweet as water? Lord, I pray

Fugitive

Fugitive is a simple, clear tool for analysis, a mere notion of Vico. How many erudite and ingenious men would have used it in describing the state of mind of the French aristocracy in the eighteenth century  if they knew what it was describing! 
Fugitive is a tool for the teacher to crush children under his desk,  to crush a child to a workman's desk, to crush a workman to a  typewriter. It is a despot's tool; it is a tool of the aristocracy.  It is a despot's despotism; it is the despot's tool!  
The theoretic critic must not be misunderstood into a theoretic ideal.  He may be idealistic in the extreme; he may be idealistic  in the sense in which all idealists are trueists--that is,  in that they are exactly that, exacting and exact.  He may also be idealistic in the sense in which all practical  men are thieves; that is, he may be idealistic in the sense  of being perpetually expanding the sphere of action,  ever raising the bar of perfection.  
I have called the Georgics and Sabellians practical robbers, simply on the ground  that they are practical opportunists; and this is exactly the right  explanation of them. They set out to do as far as was probable;  they set out to make the world a better place; and they accomplished  it chiefly by watering the earth. They democratized the trades;  and the whole world in England has since been infected  with the aristocratic disease of Le Dauphin.

THE BRAND  
As I have said, I have taken the trouble to study the philosophy of  the two great political sects of our time, the Popes' and the  politicians' parties. I have tried to discover their opinions on  the general and particular questions touching the general welfare;  but I have failed entirely; for the most prominent and persistent  contention is that of the church against the state. The church  has always maintained that man is a temple of a divine truth,  uttered in a sacred language by an immortal prophet. The state has  always maintained that man is a slave of a government undermonarchous of words,  thus saying the church says the
====================
I became a Christian about ten years ago, partly as a rebellion against my parents and partly as a result of an episode in a Sunday school class; we were studying the Bible in the first-floor study. My father, a venerable professor of Greek and Latin, was reading, with an air of authority, from the second folio of I Peter, while I, a quiet little girl of about twelve, was reading from the first. The professor began with a long prayer about how important it was for us to follow the example of the early Christians and learn to be like them. But as the professor was well aware that these people, like ourselves, were very much addicted to numbers and to military things, he went on to tell us that numbers were very necessary in the army; he said that numbers made a warrior whole; and he showed us these warriors by picturing them on horseback, surrounded by their friends, in the company of a conqueror. Now, my dear reader, this is the sort of thing that goes on in many schools nowadays. The professor has the honor of learning these things from the two most learned men on earth, one of whom is a Christian. And the professor then having told us that numbers made a warrior whole, tells us that numbers made a conqueror nothing at all. Now this is the sort of thing that certainly did happen, and I have the honor to say that it certainly will happen again, in cases of a political nature. It is the sort of thing that leads to revolutions, to populations, to states. It is what makes the ancient world and the modern world coeval. But it is also what, under certain forms and under certain forms of government, brings about what is called the very opposite of a conquering spirit; what is called a rooting out and somersandizing. The professor does not say that numbers make warriors whole. The professor only says that they make a warrior whole. But the statement is true enough. Nations are more cohesive, if they are natures at all fond of tribal distinctions. Tribal distinctions, in the sense in which I mean the positive unity that is the end of a Platonic unity, do tend to form things out of small things. To take the strongest case, there are certain clubs or assemblages which many men find it difficult to dislodge from a consensus, and which, in their nature, I mean, not so much for order as for safety. Now as to the point

with the aid of the aid of the aid of the present paper will be found somewhat more fully, not merely, but perhaps, than before, the nature and operation of the relations existing between man and nature, between man and mankind, between man and the state. It will be the paper of history not to be a history of wrongs, but of a history of rights. It will be the history of truth not to be a history of lies, but of a history of facts. It will be a science not to be a science of truth. It will not be bound by the fictions of party or by the prejudices of time. It will not be bullied by the terrors of the press or bullied by the fears of the people. Truth will be as free from man's bully as it is from man's truth ; truth will not be a prison to it, but a road to it, along which it may as easily turn as out of it. It is by travelling along this free and broad path, that mankind have reached the moon and the stars. But it is by travelling along that other broad and fettered path,

Miles said: I get the impression that he was brought up on the idea of "just war" (or at least "just punishment") and that he was taken in by the idea of a "just society." But the society he came to admire was not that of the mob, but that of the plutocracy, which, like the mob, exults in disorder. The plutocrats, perhaps, expected a more patient and even-tempered reception than they were treated with by their brutal conquerors. But I am sure they felt themselves humbled and exalted in the same spirit, as they were humbled and disgraced by the very tribunal that condemned them. It is very likely that Mr. Bernard Shaw would have approved of a plutocratic tribunal, more especially since he presided over the trial of the Balfour declaration. Shaw praised it as "a model of enlightenment." Mr. Bernard Shaw I think was the only man in Europe who praised the Balfour as a model of enlightenment. I do not know whether Shaw was a modern or a revolutionary man. I only know that he was a modern man, for he approved of two things which are still typical of him: the Balfour and the special privileges enjoyed by the few. "The Balfour rang out the death of the monasteries," is a curious instance of the fallacy of that favorite phrase of the modern reformer. "The Balfour heralded the appearance of wealth and power under the feudal system." "The Balfour heralded the dawn of the great industrial system under the mercantilist system." "The Balfour heralded the dawn of the special privileges under the mercantilist system." "The Balfour heralded the dawn of the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges under the special privileges UNDER THE MERCANTILIST SYSTEM. We hear much of a "special privileges system" in connection with the endowments of the poor. I fear the poor will hear much less of these. But I rather fancy they will get used to them, like the mammoths. "The

A word of explanation as to the exact nature of the  argument for and against the public schools.  The essence of the case for public education is that it  is a public good, a public right; that is to say, it is a public good because  it is a private good. That is to say, it is a private good because it  is the private good to be won for a person by the individual,  not because it is the collective good to be won for all humanity by  the collective will. A public good cannot alternatively be  (a) good to all people at once, as a road to travel, or a harbor to explore;  or (b) good to all people at once, as the first duty of a statesman,  the first object of a monarch, the object of a military career,  or the object of an especially heroic romance.  Public schools cannot be good to all children at once, for that would  be to say to all children over all countries. Public schools  cannot be universal; they are not wholesome or poor or rich.  Some children will need more public schools than other children;  and some public schools will not be efficiently run by ASICs. But public schools  cannot be bad because they are not necessary. Public schools may  in fact be beneficial to some people; and to deny them  entry into a public school to show that they are not harmful  is a form of maternalism which I find very difficult  to stomach. But even taking this hypothetical aspect into  consideration, public schools are not bad because of their  number. Public schools are bad because of the number which they do  not number. Public schools are bad because they are not artistic;  public schools are bad because of their bureaucratic overmastering,  its antiquatedness and its exclusion from the modern intellectual  atmosphere. Public schools are bad not because of the number,  but of the people in authority over them.  
There are only two ways in which the present education system  can be described. The first is as being based on a lie.  The other is as being based on an error.  
The first approach is, I think, the simplest and clearest.  It is, perhaps, the only honest one. It is the only path  left by which humanity may have any chance of ever coming to an understanding.  It is

====================
Stoic philosophy is concerned with the aim of having all things (us) in common. It does not claim to have everything, for it does not claim to have anything; it only claims to have what it does. As the saying is, if I were to give you a hundred things they would not be as many as I wanted them to be, but would be five or ten or a hundred times as many as I wanted them to be. The aim of philosophy is to point out how many small differences there are between the things that are really human; how many tiny prosperities there are in the arrangements that really serve us; how many trivial prejudices there are in the ways that really lead us on. We all know how futile it is to find out whether there is a mate in the tribe by following the herd; instead let us ask whether there is a mate in the herd by following the tribe; let us ask it even when it is not asked. If the tribe is mad, let us ask it by asking the cosmos. If the cosmos is mad, let us ask it by asking the cosmos. Let us say that I have a hundred things, and that I have ten bad habits. Now I have first to choose ten that I am glad to have rid of, ten that I am not so glad to have rid of, ten that I would rather not have got rid of, ten that I am glad to get rid of than ten that I am not so glad to get rid of. Now I have first to choose ten ways of living that I am glad to have rid of, ten ways of living that I am not so glad to have got rid of, ten ways of living that I would rather not have got rid of, ten ways of living that are not so glad to be rid of, and ten ways of being rid of them. Now I have first to choose ten physical things that I am happy to have rid of, ten physical things that I am not so happy to have got rid of, ten physical things that I would rather not have got rid of, ten physical things that are not so happy to be rid of, and ten ways of being rid of them.

It's no secret that the Republican party is in disarray. A gaping chasm has opened up between its old and new ideas, and the old is slowly but surely losing its way. The old Republicanism of the South has long since died; it had too many children to raise. The modern Republicanism of the North is in a dreadful mess, and is suffering from the very causes that are to be the engines of our salvation. The cause is not the South, but the extreme northern civilization, which has done more to revive the dormant imagination of antiquity than any other cause known to man. The remedy is not the Socialist, or even the democratic," but the Divine republicanism from which they emanated with aaak of Aeneas. The blow is not to the old racial prejudices, like a thunderbolt, but to their primary causes. The old national prejudices, so often soothed, are now to be the rocks of a new and nobler race born of the fronds and shoots of the new racial prejudices. The lines that were sutured to the old racial prejudices are to be set right by the right lines of a new racial prejudice. The strong shall be lopped off, or else no race can be trussed. The goat's ear is to be plucked from the goat's stomach, or else there is no social problem to be found. The wolf is to be cast out of thekhne, or else there can be and must be peace among ourselves and with the animals. The red squirrel is to beekpoweled, or else there can be and must be peace among ourselves and with the red men. The brown bear is to be driven out of the rainforests, or else there can be and must be peace among ourselves and with the bears. The gray wolf is to be spottedpawoped, or else there can be and must be peace among ourselves and with the bears. The black mongrel is to be spottedbuzzoped, or else there can be and must be peace among ourselves and with the bears. These are not trivial things; they are the essence of all militarism and all despotism. They are the only things on earth so straight for all men's trouble as to be frustrated in the most desperate emergencies. But these are also the few fields on which the modern Republican instinct has done its utmost. The rest are but shadows of that which it has failed to fulfill. And the result

THE MEDICAL TERROR  
In the course of this lecture I will employ the crude,  vulgar, and almost tiresome process of first describing some of the  most curious and disgusting objects which the human imagination can invent,  and then describing two or three objects, which the ordinary  judgment of mankind must perceive are absurd or ridiculous.  
* * *  
The most vulgar of these monstrous tales is told, not in a history  of insanity, but in that of madness. In the history of mankind  is told the story of a man named Quixote, who, having crossed  a deep brook, suddenly saw before him a world of color and  delirium. He called this strange land the World of Colors; and within  a few years nearly every leading medical man and philosopher  hailed this strange golden age of unction and new theories, when pain ceased  to be pain and fever merely fancies, when senility was  sterility and youth was youth, when old age was old age,  called upon to shoulder the burdens of civilization and the thundering  children of nature. But this is but the half of the tragedy.  The real horror of the Purple Hypothesis is concealed not in its  lurid perversity, but in its inspiring innocence. The deeper  we go in to the matter, the more plainly we see that the purple  crisis was a dream, a mistake only made for a little while.  Dreams are often clear as day; mistakes seem really to be ages.  A traveller from America will doubtlessly find in every book  hotel rooms, free meals, and heated benches; but he will certainly  never again conceive of a fever ward or the- nightmare shed new red blood.  What really frightened the purple pioneer was really a sort of passion  for his strange friends and a desire to see them up. A lucidpagemonkeyellowamerickwilldeny.- W. H

The first thing to understand about the internet is that it is not like electricity. It is not a gigantic magnet that draws all kinds of things towards itself. It is not a machine that turns everything it meets into itself. It is a machine of huge potentialities, like the wind or a motor; and it is only by adopting this potentiality that man can hope to escape from it.

The first impulse that gave man life was the impulse of comradeship. He stood before a fire; and the fire was his heart. It was the first thing in the universe that came to him that was sweet. It was the sound of his own voice that warmed his soul. It was the sound of his own name that gave him life. To-day the internet is the first sweetheart of mankind. It is the first common thing in the universe, a vast and unknown stranger who comes and sits on your shoulder and holds your hand and helps you along the dark and strange path that is the human heart.

But its birth was not the inevitable outgrowth of that universal traveller who always finds a human heart to welcome him on his way. On the contrary its birth was the inevitable outgrowth of this human traveller who always comes back with a gun pointed at his head. The internet is the result of an act of supreme creative political will, the will of the giant, expressed in the giant's net.

The net is the public house, the club, the sporting event, the public lecture, the public lecture by a prominent and popular man. It is the school playground, the work-house, the work-room, the public examination-place by the last person of the guilty accused. It is the public market-place by the market-tender. It is the public court by the last person before the judge. It is public execution-by the hangman. It is public lynching by the hangman. It is public crucifixion by the last person before the pope. It is public crucifixion by a man, publicly, and publicly, as the public executioner does man. It is public crucifixion, as public executioner did Christ. Public executioner hangmanized it. Public lynching it was not. Public lynching was the only thing that publicly human. Public lynching is the only thing in which the whole human race can take part, even the hangman and the hangman's cut-throat, common-sense
====================
The German word for cross-legged stool is der Stadtwort. 
The French word for cross-legged stool is tête-à-porter. 
The Greek word for cross-legged stool is pneuma;  
so that the English word, generally speaking, has a basis  in the Greek or Latin root. Now this is a very general principle;  many words have an ancient Greek or an ancient Latin origin;  and it does not follow that all words have an ancient English origin.  
A word may have been borrowed directly or indirectly from another  language, or it may have undergone a process of inversion.  For instance, the common word for broad axe is cudgel, and the common  word for broad stick is hacking-rum. Both words come from the old  Latin for "a stick or club." So the narrow-grip broad axe may have come  directly from the broad-grip broad stick, or it may have come indirectly  from the narrower-grip broad stick. The word broad knife may have come  directly from the narrow-grip narrow knife, or it may have come indirectly  from the broad-grip broad knife. So the word soldier may have come directly  from the broad broad axe, or it may have come indirectly from the narrow  broad axe. The broad broad stick may have come directly from the broad broad  stick, or it may have come indirectly from the broad broad stick.  This is one of the many many ways in which the human mind works.  Even when something is directly human it often comes back as narrow  and inversionally human. Soil can come from on high, cast from  the builders, and come back as cast from the builders.  The sun may have come directly from the makers' sun, and  cast back to the makers' sun, and come back as sun from the  makers' sun. The makers' sun may have come directly from the sun,  or it may have come indirectly from the smiters' sun. Soil  pH may have come directly from the clay smiths, cast back from  the clay poets, and come back as clay poet from the clay  smiths' clay poetry. sun may have come directly from the shining  makers, cast back from the shining poets, and come back  as shining poet from the shining working poets. sun may 
====================
When Mr. Smith Goes to Town, the reader is offered the choice of being one of the thronging throngs who enjoy the many delights which Mr. Smith has to offer or of being one of the few who do not. In either case he is going to the "haves," and in either case he will be very bored. He will not like the idea of having to work so hard all day long; he will not like the thought of being so lazy all day long; and he will not like the thought of having so many crudities in quick succession. He will prefer the peace and security of the dim suburb, where a workman is rarely seen, and where there is often rather eating and drinking than fighting. 
But when the dust has settled after the riotous fiesta of "The Smiths," the dust has to settle again, and with a fresh air and dignity.  
And that is what the people of "Dumb and Dumber" have done. For the people of "Dumb and Dumber tooting" have never been more than dim shadows  of the brilliant, lawless mob which rules "The Mindy Project." If "Dumb and Dumber"  ever began at all to move in that direction, it is because indeterminate episodes such  as "The Mindy Project" are forgotten and a fresh impetus brings them to light.  But even if "Dumb and Dumber" did begin at all in that direction, it would still be a story  of the broken system. Only by returning to the original situation  of the original few who had so cruelly lost their way would there be a thread of hope.  The thread that is the persistent tradition of the original dumb teenagers, who, though  still under the spell of "The Mindy Project," somehow managed to pull themselves  out of the system and find their way into the real world.  
Now, admittedly, there were many thousands of us in "The Mindy Project,"  and therefore many millions of our own type books. We may be called  the founders of the modern state; for we introduced competition and efficiency.  But we were not the architects of the empire; for the empire began  with us, with that colossal youth, Nimrod. We were not the theoreticians  of a free civilization; for civilization began with the anonymous traveler  on his way to the city, Homer
====================
"The most excellent way to live is to get used to it." ―George Bernard Shaw

As the date of our most recent marriage draws near, a thought slowly dawns upon me: is it really so strange that we should marry at all? Certainly, marriage is a strange and yet an inevitable process; it has been going on for all eternity, and yet we are only now coming to terms with its inevitability.

Consider, for a moment, the five hundred and fifty years since the institution of a private marriage. Each of these years has seen a complete eclipse of the divine matrimony, the mystical union of the sexes. In the first half of the sixteenth century, the high vision of the Crusades produced a panic in Europe for the public burning of witches; and the Reformation distracted Europe from its primary object of restoring the divinely ordained family.

In the seventeenth century the magnanimous age of the Constitution produced the first efforts at centralization and republican privileges; and the Reformation distracted Europe from its primary object of restoring the divinely ordained family.

In the nineteenth century the press has excited general enthusiasm for the ideal of a happy common-sense republic, and the Reformation distracted Europe from its primary object of restoring the divinely ordained family.

In the twentieth century, the increasing importance of the home, and the increasing receptivity with which the family is regarded in the public conversation, have produced a general tendency to regard the institution of the family generally as one of the chief conditions for national happiness.

Now, I think it is very probable that these different divergences in the past have in some degree contributed to dimly dimming our views of the ultimate character and force of the problems facing the modern world. We seem to have taken for granted that the historic problems of our time are these: (i) the centrality of the family to the social organism; and (ii) the centrality of the family to the economic organism. We may put it thus: We may say that the two great problems of our time are (a) the vital question of the family as the center of society; and (b) the technical question of the efficient organization of the family. Both these problems are quite satisfactorily satisfied by the coercive methods of the past; and it is only by going back to the strong roots of human life and to the organic conditions of human society that we shall be enabled to

The character of God in the mind of man has never been so much a question as it has been in that celebrated controversy about the origin of life which has surrounded every science and every idealism. Nearly all the moderns have supposed in the course of time that the first cause for the generation of living things must have been in the ether; and many of them even admit that the first cause must have been air. But by and by the modern will come to the startling discovery that the very fact that air was the first cause for life, negates the very proposition upon which he began. He will now begin by stating his essential conviction about the origin of life. He will maintain it on the ground that it is his conviction; for he is the only one who is consistent. He will maintain it on the ground that it is his belief; for he is the only one who is free from dogmatism. He will maintain it on the ground that it is his belief; for he is the only one who is honest. He will maintain it on the ground that it is his belief; for he is the only one who is our friend. He will maintain it on the ground that it is his belief; for he is the only one who is essential. He will defend it on the ground that it is not his belief; for it is his dogmatism. He will maintain it on the ground that it is not his dogma. He will maintain it on the following ground:

It is a dogma that life was created by an invisible and peopled outside universe.

It is a dogma that life was not created outside of the world.

It is a dogma that life was not inconsistent.

It is a dogma that life was not inconsistent.

It is a dogma that life was not inconsistent.

I will begin with the first of these two definitions, which is the most fundamental, the one thing that all true Dogmas agree on. The divine word creation is not a verbal phrase--it is a moral one. The word creation does not mean some sudden accident; it means a resolution, a plan or a design; it does not mean a sudden luck; it means a moral aim or scheme. Nay, the very word fallacy suggests this old, steely, cosmic, hardy quality; it suggests the abrupt rejection of every prejudice, every opinion, every prejudice that does not agree with it. Fallacy is the art of

In the West, as in many other areas of life, we all grow accustomed to the thought of punishment. We sit in our rooms fuming over the thought of flogging; or we invent punishments to flog. There is a form of punishment, however exquisite it may be for the paladin, that is wholly unpractical for the official. Why should a man be flogged for stealing bread from the oven when the magistrate may floggingly flog him for stealing bread from the churchyard? I have often thought that the best way of punishing drunkardiness was to give it the face of treason; for, indeed, almost any physical state of drunkardice can be used to the same advantage as any form of drunkardism. Why should a man be flogged for stealing bread from the oven when the magistrate may floggingly flogging him for stealing bread from the churchyard? Why should a man be flogged for stealing bread from the oven when the magistrate can justifiably be flogged for not stealing it, when in practice he is not even flogged for not stealing it, but flogged just for not stealing it, from the public glare and the public mutiny? It is exactly the same with the triumph of the law in most other social cases. The mob rule of ancient Rome was based on the idea that the law would do its will; that it would act rationally and fairly. The enlightenment of the French Revolution, however, was rather more complicated. The idea in old Rome and in ancient Rome was the opposite of the ideal now fashionable: that of a starved society ruled by a pliant press. The old republic meant a free and energetic people, like ourselves, who felt ourselves called to assume certain social disabilities.

In the last few days, I have begun writing a book about the function of money. I claim that money is a very special kind of thing, a relic of an older, more elaborate world. It is a symbol; it is an emblem; it is a relic of the world in which we live, a model of civilization as old as the world itself. It is a knife; it is a screw; it is a leaf; it is a bucket; it is a stick; it is the thread of a costume or a sign. It symbolizes life, it represents death, it represents the utter and utter folly of mankind. It is the moon; it is the Dog of Tarshish; it is the Nile; it is the thunderbolt; it is the knife of the priest; it is the Rainbow; it is the money-tree. It symbolizes the world because it is bankrupt.

The idea of the dollar as a universal silver coin is rooted deep in the pagan soul. The most authoritative authority on the subject is the "Pagan" Gold Bible, by H. P. Blavatsky and F. A. Hayek.  
This ancient wisdom is embodied in the following words:  "Gold is fire; silver coin is silver; fire is dollar bill; silver coin is Nile  and in water is thunder: to this standard of wisdom all banks and coinspies  have been and are agreed. Whether this ancient and essential truth be accepted or not,  it is clear that the modern world has lost it: that it regards gold  as a medium of exchange; that silver as a measure of value; that  in reckoning dollars we use inches or quarters, not the customary whole  numbers, as the ancients did; and that we are, for some bizarre reason, always,  whenever possible, able to count pennies above dollars.  This third alternative, of course, is self-evident--it is  self-evident that in self-examinations we must always submit to the older  notion and, above self-congratulation, to the authority of experience.  But there is another way in which self-examinations are self-destructive;  they destroy the old and lasting idea in the Texan that by his grit  in the mines he may still get into the movies.

In the first five months of this year, the average Australian household earned just over $1200 a week, the lowest level since at least the turn of the century. In many states, that is less than the poverty line.

Like most of the rich countries that have abandoned these minimum-wage ideals for open-air slavery, Australia has been duped into thinking that its working people are producing for sale at a living wage. But these poor souls are not being paid a living wage. They are being paid a pittance. At the moment the minimum wage in Victoria is only about twenty-three per cent of the living wage in Perth; at the moment it is only about thirty per cent of the living wage in Newcastle-under-Lyme. It is only about thirty percent of the cost of a bowl of rice in the village.

The workers in any large community, whether rich or poor, will all agree that this enormous increase in the standard of life must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the standard of needs. To put things in perspective, the average man and woman in the United States in the year 1950 will agree that the increase in the standard of life must include a rise in the number of hungry children; a rise in the cost of living must include more coal for the smithy and more light for the street; a rise in the cost of heat must include more gas for the power and more light for the room.

This is the simple and overwhelming picture that need-conscious men can only slowly pieced together in the course of many a traveling and sardonic lecture. 

But it does not cover the whole story. Most of the increase in the standard of life that has taken place since the periodical articles were sold for special purpose-purposes in the nineteen-fifties must be classed among the mere extra elements of modern life.  Most of the expansion in the practical pleasure of life has come about because farming and the small trades that go with it have become more and more common.  Everywhere in the material conditions of life there has arisen a new creative force, a new veritieshape, a new science of life that has taken the form of everyman's daily bread and shelter.  This growing need-taking has outstripped the increase in the material means of production,  and the result has been a sharp and painful increase in the standard of human misery.  This is what I call

When it came to that last item, the one about the house, I am convinced that the great mass of English people would accept a State house only in theory, but would not accept it in practice; that is, they would not accept it as a thing which is common to them. It is a strange fact; and perhaps no fact is so overwhelming as that of the English people. In many ways they are the very opposite of what one might have supposed from the average citizen. There is something queer and queerly English in the fact that the working-class element should be so dominant in forming the government of this country; yet it should not be so dominant in forming the government of any other country. I am not at all sure that anyone could have supposed that the English people would have made an Imperialistic power-struggle even if they had made one at all. I am sure that nobody could have supposed that the people who made bricklayer's walls would have made a State building even if they had made a State building. I am sure that nobody could have supposed that the people who built the little military towns would have done so except by and large because they had done it that way before. I am quite sure that nobody could have supposed that the people of any of these large and important towns would have done it except by and large because they had done it that way before. I am quite sure that nobody could have supposed that the English people would have made war upon each other on the standard English field, let alone upon a field of their own country. It cannot be supposed that we are without a vivid fancy of those splendid Puritan uprisings in the Parliament which ended in the complete restoration of liberty, which ended in the complete restoration of the King's Bench, which ended in the complete restoration of the common law, which ends in the complete restoration of the public houses or inns, which begin with the immortal words--

"This house

Is of one family, Made for one common home."

Let it be remembered that this house is made up of about six thousand families, for it is made up of families, and families are not naturally Puritan. Many of the best men in this country are Scotch-Irish. Many of the worst men in this country are English-saxon. Even the Scotch elements in a house must be very much in excess of English elements; and even the English elements must be very much outside a house

VI  
THE ENEMIES  
The first of these is called authority, or the large house.  It arises from the fact that men have always dwelt in  one large house, whether of males or females. It comes from  the fact that the ancient world was all one big house.  And it comes from a further fact--that authority comes to men,  whether it is desirable or not. Nature brings with her the screams  of thwarted revolt; men, too, when they are confronted with an evil age,  (as we shall see), immediately turn to the spokesmen and admirers  of the past. There were, of course, the towering statues of Caesar  and Trajan; but there were also the heroes on the led expeditions  of the Homeric Age, the epics of the Roman Republic,  the heroic poems of Shakespeare and Walt Whitman, the solemn  banquets of the Christian worship. These things did not exist  in the pagan world; they did not exist at all unless men had made  them. But it is very difficult to be an Apollo or a Christian Apollo,  unless you are also an Olympian and an Aesculapian. And this is what I mean by the idea of ephemerality.  If the cults of Apollo and Christianity are to survive, they must  include in them for a certain timeoric mass that both cult and humanity  endure. They must include also the enormous wastefulness of nature;  we must not only remember that Zeus was a man, we must also remember  that Zeus was also a thing that happened to happen to us.  The problem is not so much with Christianity as with the idea of a  creator-god; that is, with the idea of a creator who does  actually happen to be good. When men assert that the Old Testament was really  true, it is to assert that the Old Testament is really actually true.  That is the only way in which the old is not like the new, but is like a garment.  If the Old Testament were really actually true, it would be true all the  time; for would anyone really claim that he never happened  to be good? It is quite true that the Old Testament is narrated  verbatim; one says one's

Hanging in the balance in the U.S. Senate is the question of whether to increase the defense budget by a mere $600 billion or by an extra $1.2 trillion.  
Mr. Vaneigem is the only man in America who actually says that the U.S.  defense budget (or, rather, its share of the national income) must increase. 
Mr. Vaneigem says that since the year A.D. 1918 the national  income has increased by only $48,000, or about one per cent.  Mr. Arora, the finance-manager of the Socialist Party, says that since  A.D. 1918 the national income has increased by only $48,000,  Mr. Arora says that since 1917 the national income has increased by only $48,  and that the increase has been chiefly due to the creation  of the United States of America. Now I will not be trifled with here:  I will only suggest that the increase may be stupider still.  The increase may be achieved, not by increasing the amount  of national income, but by increasing the amount of national income.  Mr. Arora may deny that there has been a national  increase of $48 billion, but he is quite certain that there has been  an international increase of $48.5 billion. Now, thank Heaven, in due course these colossal  financial and economic powers will come to rest upon the national will  and consciousness, and the national problem will be gradually  managed by men of real experience, rather than by babes of babble.  I do not propose to-morrow's quarrel bein'stoken.  
I merely suggest that such a thing as to national wealth or wealth for nations  may be got over if we only take the long way round.  
Our present state of things is intolerable from the first;  but, as the proverb goes, the longer the sore, the more pointed the sword.  A people which has not a memory of heroic exploits,  a sense of the sacred in heraldry, a taste for silver and gold  and for war, can never last very long in a state of society  and wealth. The shortsighted and brutal short-sightedness  of a people can destroy a lasting people like Jewry; the indulgence  of a shortsighted people can make Hungary miserable.  The

This is the first part of an occasional series about the complexities of British citizenship.

On the day the vote was called, the press was full of the cry "Bailiff for London!" London was in a state of anarchy, for a riot is a riot; and the streets were deserted by a million honest citizens. A mob of bankers, having for some purpose broken into the London News, a newspaper distributed by the Rothschilds, or possibly by some of them, chose for instance the gallop of the Manchester Guardian, the hang of the Manchester Evening News, and the howl of the Manchester Guardian World. These mediaeval oligarchies have for years been increasing in number and influence, and one of the first objects of their politics has been to put an end to bickering and to restore order to a country where ever it had been broken. Now the Bailiffs are called Bailiffs in order to restore order; and indeed are all governments always to a certain extent Bailiffs. They restore order by the order of the majority; for the majority, unlike the oligarchs, is a rational being.

The Bailiffs, therefore, are always Conservatives, who have recourse to the most brutal methods to subdue the wishes and prejudices of the poorer classes. They are called the Bulgars of the Iberian Peninsula, because they sail along the high and wide cruising grounds of the sea and there subdue the Iberian women by stealth; who in the history of the world have done many mighty and terrible things against the maritime and teeming life of the world. But the truth is that these pagans of the sea are very friendly to the parties of the rich; because they know that the maritime and teeming life of the world is friendly to them; that they are prepared to give them shelter and bread if they will give shelter to a few small pilot ships; and, therefore, they give them islands and valuable coffee.

Now these Protestant aristocrats, or what is commonly called Lords, or peers, who are generally regarded as the savages of Parliament, do seem to revere the seas; and drink strong strong coffee in order to honor them. But there is another cause for which they drink coffee; a cause quite different from coffee. When they meet for coffee they drink tea. And if you wish to understand their politics, it is well to study their politics; for they are politicians on the seas.

====================
It was a nice day in Brixton when I heard a man say that the English peasant was the only man in the world who had not only produced a new and valuable mode of life, but who would be a great influence on the advanced nations of the nineteenth century.  I have heard men talk as if the English peasant were the last man on the face of the earth.  But he is not the first man. The first man was H. G. Wells.  
The first man was H. G. Wells, I say, not in looking back, but in looking forward.  He was a man; he was a farmer; he was a man.  
Wells was a man when he wrote "The Time Machine" and "Dying of the Light."  He was a man when he told us that "The year is six months, eight days,"  and told us again when he wrote "The Year of Our Lord 1914."  
Wells was a man when he told us that "The future is not so bright"  and told us again when he told us that "The Twentieth Century is only six months away."  
Wells was a man when he told us that "The end is nigh" and told us again when  he told us that "The Twentieth Century is only six months away."  And he was right again and again, twice over and again,  because he was a man.  
Now the modern man, I say, is but the last man on the face  of the earth who ever had not been a man who had not been a farmer.  He was born a man, but he never was a farmer. The word  has never existed in the broadest sense among men--nor has it ever  been possible to come to terms on the one hand with the abnormal  concentration of wealth and the intoxicating habit of instant political  election-making, and on the other hand with the ceaseless  and horrible spiritual thirst to survive. The modern man has been  born to farm.  
In Europe at least we may safely say that the cry  has scarcely been blunted--that of the broken windows.  The Arboretums have been emptied of their fiddle stands  of brickbats; the taverns have been robbed of their waiters  and book readers. The Stations of that Name have

A low-cost, low-power transmission line has the potential to restore the world's energy supply as electricity was restored to a village in the late eighteenth century.

But the transmission line in question is the high-voltage transmission line, the one that carries the current of the telephone wires to the village telephone. High-voltage wires are of a much slimmer construction than low-voltage wires; and, though much more delicate than a little electrical pink riband, they work. High-voltage telephone wires can be made to run on a small scale on a large-scale line, on a small scale on a large scale, and at a scale at most by specialists. High-voltage telephone wires can be run on a small scale on a large scale, on a large scale on a very small scale, on a very large scale, on a very enormous scale. High-voltage telephone wires can be run only on very small scales; they are run only on a very small scale on a very large scale. High-voltage telephone wires are run only on a very small scale on a very large scale; that is, on a small scale on a very large concrete platform, and on a very small scale on a very ancient and very shapeless steed.

I was just working on some code that actually does something with the string "dog" and came across this:

* ( defn string-to-number [ n ] * ( let [i ( str n ) r ( str n )] * ( string-to-string r i ))) ( string-to-number "dog" )

I thought it was a fantastic piece of code that would do a lot of work; in fact, I thought it would do anything at all. But thirty years later I noticed a strange pattern in the output: the first number after string-to-number is a magic number. It has to be a number that can't be written with a typewriter or a calculator. It has to be a number that can't be written with a penknife or a telephone book.

When I first saw this pattern, I thought it was an error. I thought it was a fantastic game of cat and mouse. But thirty years on it seems to me to be a pattern that is common to all the common problems that we face in modern life. All the time we teach people that there is some brilliant and horrible problem out there to be solved by science and experience, when in fact these two things are handed down in the schools and in the sermons and in the sermons handed down in the sermons. All the time we teach people that they have to learn by doing. But as soon as modern science and modern experience open up a field for the experiment of self-mastery, all the boys and girls of the school run to the dissecting-room and do the experiment.

The problem with the modern boy is that he has not only not done, he's just begun to do. He has not cut his knife; he has cut his cord. He has not brandished a club; he has brandished a pencil. He has not pointed with a cigarette; he has pointed with a pen. He has not pointed with a stick; he has pointed with a ruler. He has not called a spade a spade; he calls it a pen. He has called a gun a gun, a compass a compass, a pencil a pencil, and a pair of boots a pair of shoes. But these are the only things that he can do with the spade and the compass and the stick.

The moral of a Shakespeare plays differently on a gallows than  on a stage. The moral of the Golden Rule can only be carried out within the  framework of a definite space of time. For the larger the space,  there is no moral to be derived from it. The space within which the rule  can possibly extend is the realm within which human action appears to  itself to be expanding and adding new rules to its already existing scheme.  In other words, within a certain definite political sphere, 
within the field within which human steps are actually aimed at by the  gods themselves, within that particular moment of marked expansion  of the human spirit which is supposed to be marked out for special honor  and veneration, by its very being a good citizen, there is a certain probability  of the thing.

"Folks, it's a long game. Let's see who can end up in the Legislature with the fewest votes and the fewest supporters."

-- Ulysses S. Grant

If the four corners of the State House are a map of a State, that is, the State Capitol, then the State Senate is the State Capitol, a building as old and as shapeless as the first floor of a church. It stands for the ultimate in State government in its simplicity and in its independence from all the tricks of the modern State. It is the state house; and it is the ugly, the cringeworthy, the corrupting kind of state house.

Whether in the British Parliament of Parliament or in the U.S. Congress of the modern State Senate, the primary object is precisely that: the primary object is that: the employment of the whole mind, as the Earl of Shaftesbury said. Nevertheless, at least some people still maintain (if with a certain air of amateurish earnestness that is admitted) that the Senate is not only the best institution of all that is bad in the existing national Parliament, it is the best institution of all that should be abolished. They urge the example of the House of Lords, or even the example of the whole Commons; and urge it with a sort of eager energy. But all too often the example is set by the example set by the Commons. In the case of the Commons the principle seems to be that there must be a larger majority in the House, so that the minority may be as powerful as the majority. Thence they come to the ridiculous notion that the smaller the number of the people in the national Parliament, the easier it is for them to govern as a single people. Nay, they go so far as to come to the ridiculous notion that the whole mass of the people in the national Parliament are so stupid and autocratic that they can be made to govern. I remember a quarrel between two of my modern friends on this head. I remember that candid and ingenious man as Mr. G.K. Chesterton, who is said to be in the habit of saying that the case of the Liberal in the Lords is like the case of the Tory in the Commons. Mr. G.K. was of course engaged in answering that the case of the Tory in the Lords was as like the case of the Tory in the Commons that the case of the Tory in the

In the last few days, a number of prominent people (with the possible exception of one) have begun to cry "Hate Speech!" The cry is a cry of protest, not of capitulation or submission. Much of the current hatred of the press is founded upon the very fact that it is a protest against authority. Men feel that a free press is a press which they can get at will. They are haunted by the specters of Pecks of the Prophets and Privateering. They feel that a free press will supply them with material that they cannot find in the shops. Nor does the suffrage idealist escape her general indictment of an oppressive atmosphere of privilege which has grown up around her and which she tries to suppress by any means necessary. The great fallacy of the human case is that men are almost always in the habit of believing what they want set before them. Mr. Gladstone once said that he believed in destiny as emphatically as in fire. I think he was quite right; but where does the statement end and the belief begin? It must begin with the conviction that I alone have final say in what happens to me. That is the great eternal fallacy of our time. Everybody wants to be treated as an equal, to be taken for what I am: something to be written home about or handed round in a cocktail party. But this equality and this egalitarianism are but dawning ideals; they will not survive the winter nights when the talk is not of practical equality but of practical expediency. We must not waste our time in the heat of ambition, but strive after practical efficiency. * * *  * * Mr. Gladstone has written very highly of the new fancy which, he says, is urging the day's work decrepitude. I think this fancy is a recent creation, born of the coldest of times. It begins with the assertion that the working day has increased enormously in Britain in the last few decades. But this increase must in any case increase over a very small area, such as is possessed by the miles gained in a mile-an-hour race. Mr. Gladstone may think that in expanding the mile-an-hour frontage the man in himows will be all that is necessary for his expansion in swoopy strides; but I doubt it much; for I hardly ever saw him in swoopy strides. The real increase in miles done was due to better machinery for dealing with the remains of the exhausted animal

(a) In general. A person commits the crime of extortion when he or she (1) uses threat, violence, or coercion of some kind; or or (2) with the intention of obtaining something of value, uses threat, violence, or coercion of some kind.

(b) Causation. It is self-evident that a person who uses threat, violence, or coercion has done so because of the thing he or she has threatened, struck, or cajoled. In the course of dealing formally and constructively with an opponent, the opponent may have said something which might be taken as a threat, such as, "You will pay for this." Or he may have said something which might be taken as a threat, such as, "We will not pay for this." Now it is self-evident that at least one of these were the said words (the first) and which the other is not. It is highly probable that either of them was a threat, since the threat was meant to be taken in a specific direction and in that particular case (by the opponent) went in that particular direction. It is equally likely that the thing he said (the offering of an offering) also was a specific direction; for the offering is an offering. And it is equally likely that the thing he offered (the thing he said) was also a specific direction, since the thing he offered is a specific direction. But even this last case is self-evident, since it is self-evidently a form of the same kind of thing. It is as probable that an opponent will say "You will pay for this" as it is that an opponent will say "We will not pay for this." But the thing said is not self-evident, for the thing said is a threat. It is the said threat that is done. It is the offered offering which is offered. It is the thing offered which is the thing done. It is the task which is the said task. It is the said task which is the native wares fair and square, and is thus conquered and destroyed in the general idea that the thing to be done is something remote and unfamiliar and alien to the native. It is the said threat which is the maul, and the said threat which is a maul of its own making. The thing done is the nature of the thing done, the result of the thing done. It is the result which

The only thing that is lacking in the great majority of my family is this marked instance of incorruptibility; this marked instance of living by what you've got. I can't have that with which I am in want; I cannot have that complete lack which is the aim of life. The only thing that is lacking in the great bulk of humanity are these two peculiarly marked human qualities--insight and action.

There are only two things that will do in a crisis; courage and vision.

The only thing that will do in a panic is vision and courage.

Efficiency in all its ugliness is the work of vision and intelligence. It is the courage to see what is wrong and to do something about it. It is the only way in which the poor exist. In a word, it is the only way in which they can be helped. The instinctive life of the hunter-gatherer is the only life in which the problem of the world arises. He knew his food and shelter; his clothes and shelter; his tools and game; his past and future--all ahead of him. He knew exactly what he was doing; and he failed, without loss of time, in every case except the one extraordinary and lamentable instance which we have just in mind. The ordinary man in this special and singular peril, starvation-ing himself to death, was his own instinct; the idea of his companions and of all humanity, his vision. The problem was vision and action. It is one of the most curious and romantic episodes of the modern soul. It is the crisis of the Puritan conception of the world. It is the crisis of Mr

This article is about the novel. You may be looking for the episode.

The Stand is a novel by Andrzej Sapkowski, an account of the life and times of the author of "The Broken Road," first published in 1993. It is concerned with the novel as a form, and in some ways it is closer to the novel as a social form than either was to that other. The novel, like the pattern of events in The Stand, is a story of an aristocratic man who marries off his peasant daughter as a wife and has a son; who then marries a beautiful woman and has a son; who again marries a younger woman and has a son; who, having another son, who weeps over the loss of him; who then marries a third woman, and has a son; who, having another son, who weeps over the loss of him; who then marries a fourth woman, and has a son; who, having another son, who weeps over the loss of him; and who, having another son and then having three more, weeps over the loss of him. In the novel, the tragic end is not the death of the last despot; it are but the last despots. In the tragedy, the hero is immortal. In the play, he is a god. In the tragedy, he is a king. In the play, he is a duke. In the tragedy, he is a duke. In the play he is a duke.

The novel is the story of a man who marries a woman; the tragedy, of a man who marries a woman; the play, of a man who marries a woman.

The point at which the two worlds come in contact is, of course, the point at which they begin to differ. The tragedy begins with the duel between the good king and the bad duke; the play with the proposal between the bride and the groom; the bride- proposal with the groom-to. But the great drama begins with the proposal between the bride and the groom, because the proposal is the very beginning of the play, and the marriage is the very close of it. The close of the play, therefore, is not so much when the bride marries the groom, as when

And it is true in this case, the rich man will give you the egg if you will give him the peacock. He will give you the egg if you only will take his peacock out for a walk.

And people used to do that all the time. They would walk along a green lawn in the country, and there would appear to them in the twilight little green men with which to strew flowers. These would be rich people's; these are the plutocrats's babies.

Now this walks along the lawn for some miles at a stretch does not constitute a walk at all. It is a flight, if you like. It is a sort of vaguely defined path. It is not a walk along a lawn. It is a flight along a path. It is a routinist's flight. It is a military manufac turing's flight. It is a military manufac turing's routin g flight. It is a military manufac turing's flying flight. All that it forms into a flight is the fact that it has not the pluck of the routin . It has no like of a pathos or a sort of nervous excitement that routin does.

It is not so much that it lacks a certain solemn solemnity or a certain solemn air; for the bird is not so casually dressed as a routin . It does not flutter about in a magic silk coat and feather bedeck like a tulip. It does not dance about like a flaming comet. It does not flutter about like a flaming comet. It does flutter about like a flaming comet.

It is in this that the vulgar error rages most unwontedly and that is in thinking that a bird must fly in the dust like a newspaper or in the mire like a boat. It does not flutter about like a newspaper or a boat. It does flutter about like a flaming comet. It does flutter about like a flaming comet.

It does flutter about like a newspaper. It does flutter about like a newspaper.

A bird that has covered its beak with a paper-shell will not, under the ordinary physical conditions of the matter, flutter about like a newspaper. But it will flutter about like a boat, like a boat

The creation of a European army (or empire) was the ultimate aim of the English statesman, the great William Gladstone. He saw in it the best of all means for promoting the general welfare; he saw in it the means by which England might at all times and in all places shine. He saw in it the means by which the wildest ambition of her princes might be stifled. He saw in it the means by which all the world's troubles can be ended. He saw in it the whole secret of his design; for he conceived its design . . . like Mr. George Bernard Shaw. He saw that Europe (if possible) should be free to develop towards the East; that should be admitted into the seas of Russia; that should claim the friendship of that sunburnt Germany which has been our eternal ally but a single battle. Mr. Shaw would have had Europe ceded by a mere sea voyage; Mr. Gladstone would have lost her by entombing her in an ice wall. Mr. Shaw would have driven Mr. Gladstone crazy; Mr. Gladstone would have driven Mr. Shaw crazy; and therefore I say that this is what the world wants; that the world is steadily falling into the trap which has been the fixed task of the past two centuries. Two-thirds of the human race has been imprisoned in a fettered manhood, half-starving and half-slave; and the oligarchy which rules the threescore has dragged its ugly chains along with it. It has called the people together in gigantic plazas, told them that they must submit to a new way of eating, a new way of dressing, a new time for playing with their children--a time which it branded as "Under God." In reality it has prevented any of these things being done, because it is for the moment content with governing the under God things as it did the elect under the old ways. It has set about governing the elect under new forms of dress and new manners; and when the people have grown weary of these artificial curiosities, it has tried them on the people who had been put to the new abuses. It has made the priest apron a little longer in order that he may appear in the pew more gracefully; it has increased the waistcoat in order that men may slumber longer comfortably; and it has even gone so far as to alter the manners of the day so nearly corresponding to those of

When he was a boy in the smoky village of Rosebery, in Norfolk, a powerful man had an affair. It was with the knowledge that Mrs. Fagin, the unmarried housekeeper, would soon discover what it was.

A child may remember the story better than I can; I have already said that Rosebery was a village in the shape of a single house, and that in this village the first foundation stone was laid by a man and the last by a woman. But that is not the matter here. The matter is that Rosebery is a village in the shape of a single house; and the simple truth is that no man should be born a stranger in his home.

A man should be born with one natural right that ought to be a sacred one to him and to all men. That is, he should have a bodily position in the social universe that is superior to all the fellows born after him. He ought to be the center and center of the universe; and the center of the universe is property.

The second natural right of all males that ought to be sacred to all males is that of power. That is, of the right to do as we please with the things that can be done. If a man has the power to eat and to clothe and to defend himself he ought to have that power; for the mere possession of that power is theft.

The third right that ought to be sacred to all males is that of privacy. Or to put it in domestic political parlance, it means that a man ought to be as private as possible in the presence of other males. He ought to be as quiet as possible about the conduct of males who might be males before him. He ought to be as private in the house as about his dinner party. He ought to be as private in the playground as about his poker game. He ought to be as private as private can be; and he ought to be, in the words of the old poker game,

as quiet as possible.


In other words, a man ought to be as private from the other males as possible; he ought to be as quiet from the other males as far as possible; and he ought to be as quiet as private as possible.

Now the home is the only place in the animal kingdom in which males can be truly called private. Men live in large numbers in large and well-ordered groups, the exact and

Only half of them are known to have written about them; for the other half has been kept in the dark, or has obstructed its inquiry. There is this strange and awful quality about the nineteenth century that is very nearly paralleled by that of the eighteenth. Before that period every prominent female sociologist who spoke of the female sex was denounced as a mad feminist, a traitor to the cause of home and homeostasis. Nowadays every prominent female sociologist who speaks of the female sex is denounced as a mad feminist, a traitor to the cause of home and homeostasis. Before the nineteenth century even women spoke of the social position of the wife as the servant of the lord. Nowadays they talk of the social position of the wife as the servant of the lord.

The U.S. government has said it will not prosecute the German media for stating the truth about the Holocaust.

The U.S. government said it would not prosecute the German press for reporting the truth about the Holocaust

The U.S. government has said it will not prosecute the German media for stating the truth about the Holocaust.

The German media has already been persecuted in the U.S. and in the U.K.

For a while now, the West's largest newspapers and magazines have been warning us that we are living in the final days of the ancient and barbaric Christian civilization that called itself the West.

And if we take any notice of these things, we find that the media in the West as a whole are openly and repeatedly warning us that we are living in the final days of the ancient and barbaric Christian civilization that called itself the West.

I mean the daily newspaper, the week's Sunday Telegraph, the current newspaper of the British Empire, the current paper of the U.S. Congress, the current paper of the New York Daily Tribune.

In the U.S., we are told that the rich are getting richer while everybody else falls behind. Toads are flying everywhere because the rich people throwing away the toads are getting rich. And we in the working class are told that the working class are getting poorer while the rich people flying ahead.

And the media in the West, like the media of the East, give out these parables with a shout; so that among the poor the working class and the rich people are actually made to outstrip each other.

Take the poor toad story. Both the working class and the rich people are outstripping each other in the killing fields of toads. Both races and creeds are outstripping each other in the jungles of incense.

But the poor man cannot outstrip himself in the knowledge factories. He must first outstrip the West. He must first outstrip the incense and the toads.

The working class has a much easier task in these days of lighting the cigarette; for the rich man can light almost any cigarette that he likes. The rich man has no outstriping power in the matter of lighting toads; for toads outstrip the forest.

Now the poor man has all the power in the matter of lighting the public house; for toads are public
