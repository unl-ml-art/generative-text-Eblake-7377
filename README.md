## Abstract

I plan to create text generated images using the GPT-2. Creating a database of typed images (examples shown below) I plan to create other iamges. I have found a website that converts images into text, by colecting a range of photos I hope that I will be able to produce a handful of text that creates some sort of an image. Each peice will have a title and statment behind it that will be gerneated. Since these images will serve as a "art series" an artist statment will be needed. I will organize a set of artist statemnts so that the text generator can create some sort of personality for the artist as well as the "process" or materials used to make the art. For the final deliverable, I want to create photos that document "the gallerty" either by creating a space in unreal engine or therough adobe demisions. Using these photos of the gallery, I could make a fake page that belongs to the artist.

The first two images are set to a high resolution and the last one is set to a medium resolution

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
